Conversation/acObj/Line01082=那些海盜就是學不乖，對吧？指揮官，給他們一點教訓。 /// These pirates just don't learn, do they? Commanders, it's time to educate them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01083=那些可惡的海盜很快就有苦頭吃了。指揮官，解決掉他們。 /// These wretched pirates are about to get a helluva lot more than they bargained for. Take them out.

Conversation/acObj/Line01293=又死了一隻元素獸。只剩一隻了。 /// Another elemental vanquished. Only one remains.
Conversation/acObj/Line01294=兩隻元素獸都一命嗚呼了。讓第三隻跟牠們團聚吧。 /// Two elementals have met their demise. See to it that the third one joins them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01295=真是煩人的東西。有機會的話，把最後那一隻也殺了。 /// Such troublesome creatures. Slay the last one when you have the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01296=所有的元素獸都死了。現在專心應付拉克希爾儀式吧。 /// All of the elementals have been eradicated. Now return your full attention to Rak'Shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01297=總有一天，我要讓元素獸完全滅絕。不過現在呢，先讓我們全力對付眼前這個挑戰。 /// One day, I will render those elementals extinct. But for now, let us focus our efforts on the task at hand.
Conversation/acObj/Line01298=你們殺死了附近所有的元素獸。我很欣賞你們的殘暴行為。 /// You have destroyed all of the elementals in the surrounding area. Your penchant for violence is impressive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01299=不！不可能！我是飛升者統帥！我...啊！ /// No! This cannot be! I am the First Ascendant! I...
Conversation/acObj/Line01300=指揮官，你們毀了塔達力姆！我永遠都不會放過你們！你們聽到了嗎！？ /// You have doomed the Tal'darim, commanders! I will haunt you for all eternity! Do you hear me!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01301=拉克希爾結束了。這傢伙一點本事都沒有。希望當我要求對決的時候，亞拉瑞克不會讓我這麼失望。 /// And so ends Rak'Shir. What a pathetic display. When the day comes, I hope Alarak proves to be a more fitting challenge.
Conversation/acObj/Line01302=我獲勝了。指揮官，你們的支援非常有效。等我向亞拉瑞克發出拉克希爾戰帖的時候，我會記住這一點。 /// Victory is mine. You make for effective supplicants, commanders. I will remember that when I challenge Alarak to Rak'shir myself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01303=誰敢挑戰我，就是這個下場，這場戰鬥是最好的教訓。指揮官，我很欣賞你們的表現。 /// Let this be a lesson to all who dare to challenge me. Commanders, I commend your strength in battle.
Conversation/acObj/Line01304=大領主，在我們當中有亞蒙的信徒。他們的戰將對我下了拉克希爾戰帖，打算篡奪塔達力姆的統治權。 /// Highlord, Amon's followers linger within our ranks. Their champion has challenged me to Rak'shir in order to usurp the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01305=一定要懲罰這種反叛行為。我會需要你以及你的盟友派部隊過來助我一臂之力。 /// This insubordination must be punished. I will require psionic support from both your supplicants as well as your partner's army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01306=亞拉瑞克大領主，有個飛升者是亞蒙的信徒，他向我發出拉克希爾挑戰。我們得協力合作，一同擊垮他。 /// Highlord Alarak. An ascendant who remains loyal to Amon has challenged me to Rak'shir. We must stand together to crush him.
Conversation/acObj/Line01307=只要你跟你的盟友提供幽能支援，我就不會輸。派兵協助我，我們會消滅這個叛徒。 /// Psionic support from both you and your ally would make me unbeatable. Declare for me, and we will obliterate this traitor.
Conversation/acObj/Line01308=大領主，塔達力姆發生內鬥了。有個效忠亞蒙的派系打算透過拉克希爾發動政變。 /// The Tal'darim are at odds with each other, Highlord. A faction of Amon worshipers seeks to stage a coup via the rite of Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01309=我們都知道不能放任這種事發生。我絕對不能輸，因此我需要你跟你的盟友提供幽能來協助我。 /// We both know this cannot stand. I must win this challenge, and to do that I need both you and your ally to support me psionically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01310=大領主，我需要兩支軍隊才能贏得這場挑戰。你們兩位都得派出軍隊助我一臂之力。 /// It will take more than one army's power for me to overcome this challenger, Highlord. You must both commit your forces to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01311=只有一支部隊來協助我，你這麼做有什麼理由嗎？大領主，如果我輸了，他們接下來就會對付你。 /// Is there some reason only one army is offering me support? If you allow me to fail here, they will challenge you next, Highlord.
Conversation/acObj/Line01312=要兩支軍隊同時協助，我才能打贏。亞拉瑞克，我的戰勝對你是有利的。 /// Without support from both armies, I will be unable to defeat this challenger. It's in your interest to assure my victory, Alarak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01313=我知道你對我的能力有信心，但我還是得提醒你，我需要兩支軍隊一同協助我，否則我贏不了。 /// Despite your confidence in my abilities, I must remind you that I require psionic support from both armies in order to win.
Conversation/acObj/Line01314=亞拉瑞克，你比誰都清楚，在拉克希爾儀式中，幽能支援有多重要。兩支軍隊我都需要。 /// Alarak, you know better than anyone the importance of psionic support when challenged to Rak'shir. Both armies must provide it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01330=看來你當上大領主之後，功力沒有退步。我會記住這一點的。 /// I see your blades have not dulled since becoming Highlord. I will remember that.
Conversation/acObj/Line01331=亞拉瑞克，你的戰術真高明。我向你學到了不少，受教了。 /// Your battlefield tactics are impressive, Alarak. I have ascertained much from observing them. Much indeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01332=你中斷了敵方的支援。雖然你失去了幾名戰士，但對你來說應該不痛不癢吧。 /// You've broken the enemy's support. It cost you a few warriors, but no doubt you'll manage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01333=敵人犯了嚴重的錯誤。他們的戰將失去支援了。 /// The enemy has made a grievous error. Their champion has lost his support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01334=亞拉瑞克，你的策略真大膽。既殘酷又有效。 /// A bold stratagem, Alarak. Brutally efficient at eliminating the enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01335=大領主，亞蒙的軍隊消滅了你的部隊。要記住，飛升之鍊的強度是取決於它最薄弱的那個環節。 /// Amon's forces have wiped out your army, Highlord. Remember that the Chain of Ascension is only as strong as its weakest link.
Conversation/acObj/Line01336=亞拉瑞克，我知道你的實力不只如此。派你最強的部隊來協助我，維護塔達力姆該有的秩序。 /// I know this is not the full extent of your power, Alarak. Send me your best if you wish to maintain order within the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01337=看來你有低估敵人的傾向，我會記住這一點的。不過現在，我需要你派兵支援。 /// It seems you've underestimated your opponent. I will keep that tendency in mind. But for now, I require reinforcements.
Conversation/acObj/Line01338=亞拉瑞克，你的戰士潰不成軍，我希望這種事不常發生。快派更多部隊過來支援我。 /// Your warriors have faltered, Alarak. I do pray this is not a common occurrence. Devote more of them to my support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01339=你在飛升之後，力量就衰退了嗎？還是你打算藉機除掉我？幫我贏得這場戰鬥，否則你會失去塔達力姆。 /// Has your strength waned since your ascension? Or are you trying to eliminate me as well? Win this fight, or lose the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01340=亞拉瑞克，我通知你可不是叫你來袖手旁觀的。我需要你的部隊提供幽能支援。 /// I did not inform you of this challenge so you could spectate, Alarak. I require psionic support from your army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01341=大領主，如果你想保住塔達力姆，就得讓我獲勝。事不宜遲，立刻派你的部隊來支援我。 /// Highlord, I must be victorious if you are to keep hold of the Tal'darim. Send your forces to support me without delay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01342=這可不是測試我實力的時候。派出你的部隊幫我，否則就來不及了。 /// Now is not the time to test my strength. Pledge your forces to my cause before it is too late.
Conversation/acObj/Line01343=亞拉瑞克，你知道該怎麼做。我需要援軍才能贏得這場挑戰，快點派你的部隊過來。 /// You know how this works, Alarak. I need supplicants in order to win this challenge. Send them to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01344=需要我提醒你，你的任務就是支援我嗎？如果你想看我被扔下深淵，請你親自動手。 /// Need I remind you that your objective is to support me? If you wish to see me thrown into the pit, then do it yourself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01354=大領主，我正在節節敗退。你跟你的盟友必須支援我，除非你希望他們篡位成功。 /// I am losing ground, Highlord. You and your ally must support me, unless you wish your command to be usurped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01355=亞拉瑞克，你是故意不出兵嗎？快派部隊過來支援我，我才能奪回失去的陣地。 /// I expected more from you than this, Alarak. Are you intentionally holding back? Send me support so I can regain lost ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01356=大領主，戰況對我不利。要是你再不派兵支援，你會保不住你的統治權。 /// The tide turns against me, Highlord. If you do not intervene with additional support, it will erode your rule as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01357=大領主，我已經很接近獻祭深淵了。你得立刻支援我，否則亞蒙會再度控制塔達力姆！ /// Highlord, I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. You must support me now, or Amon will be poised to conquer the Tal'darim anew!
Conversation/acObj/Line01358=亞拉瑞克，我快要到深淵了。立刻支援我！絕對不能讓我在這裡被擊敗！ /// I am within sight of the pit, Alarak. Support me now! I must not be defeated here! 
Conversation/acObj/Line01359=難道亞拉瑞克就只有這點能耐？要是我在這裡輸了，飛升之鍊就會再度被亞蒙掌控！ /// Is this the best the mighty Alarak can muster? If I lose here, the entire chain will belong to Amon once again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01360=當初亞坦尼斯支援你進行拉克希爾的時候，也這麼沒用嗎？別讓亞蒙的戰將獲勝！ /// Was Artanis's support during your own Rak'shir this ineffective? Do something, before Amon's champion wins!
Conversation/acObj/Line01361=我快要掉進深淵了！亞拉瑞克，你到底在玩什麼把戲？你希望讓他們得逞嗎？ /// I am inches away from the pit! What are you playing at, Alarak? Do you want this insurrection to succeed? 
Conversation/acObj/Line01362=大領主，立刻支援我，別把塔達力姆送給亞蒙！ /// Aid me now, Highlord, or forfeit the Tal'darim to Amon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01378=亞拉瑞克，去死吧！這就是你的計畫嗎？你害死了我們！亞蒙下一個就會對付你了！ /// Curse you, Alarak! Was this your plan all along? You have doomed us all, you fool! Amon will come for you next!
Conversation/acObj/Line01379=大領主，你失敗了！你機關算盡，結果就這樣？你已經失去塔達力姆了！ /// You have failed, Highlord! All those incessant machinations, and for what? You have lost the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01380=大領主，看來你還能再繼續統領塔達力姆，改朝換代的時刻還未到。 /// Your rule of the Tal'darim holds for another day, Highlord. It seems the time for leadership to change is not yet upon us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01381=亞拉瑞克，太精采了。別擔心，我沒打算向你下戰帖...改天再說吧。 /// An impressive display, Alarak. Fear not, I have no intention of challenging you myself. Today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01382=大領主，很感謝你出兵協助我。親眼看到你坐鎮指揮，我...獲益良多。 /// My gratitude for your declaration in my favor, Highlord. It was... enlightening to see your tactics in practice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01383=亞蒙的混源體大幅強化了他的戰將。立刻殺了牠們！ /// Amon's hybrids are greatly enhancing his champion's strength. They must be eliminated immediately!
Conversation/acObj/Line01384=這些混源體具有強大的幽能。消滅牠們，否則對方的戰將就會獲得這股力量！ /// These hybrids possess immense psionic power. Destroy them, or that power will belong to their champion!
Conversation/acObj/Line01385=亞蒙的戰將獲得了大量的幽能。快點殺掉牠們！ /// Massive psionic power flows into Amon's champion from the hybrids. Slay them quickly!
Conversation/acObj/Line01386=混源體提供的幽能會讓亞蒙的戰將獲得優勢。立刻消滅牠們！ /// Psionic support from the hybrids turns the tide in Amon's favor. Put an end to it, now!
Conversation/acObj/Line01387=混源體...牠們太強大，我支撐不了多久。殺死牠們，別讓我被擊敗！ /// Hybrids... I cannot stand against them for long. Kill them before I am overwhelmed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01388=元素獸不會在這裡徘徊太久。如果你們要去宰了牠，就不該遲疑。 /// The elemental will not linger here for long. Do not tarry if you wish to destroy it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01389=我能感覺到元素獸在躁動。趁牠還沒有跑去繁殖之前快殺掉牠。 /// I can sense the elemental's unrest. Slay it before it scurries away to breed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01390=元素獸就快離開了。能擺脫牠是不錯，但我更希望你們殺了牠。 /// The elemental will soon depart. I shall be glad to be rid of it, but I would prefer you kill it instead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01391=元素獸不久之後就會離開這裡。我希望你們能在那之前先宰了牠。 /// It won't be long before that elemental leaves this place. I'd like to see it torn apart before that happens.
Conversation/acObj/Line01392=再過不久，那隻元素獸就要逃走了。在那之前快殺掉牠。 /// You don't have long before the elemental escapes. Exterminate that pest before it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line01393=看來元素獸溜走了，真可惜啊。 /// It seems the elemental has slipped through your fingers. A shame.
Conversation/acObj/Line01394=看來那隻元素獸還能在史雷因逍遙一陣子。算了，牠逃不了多遠的。 /// That elemental remains free to roam Slayn. No matter. Its death is inevitable. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01395=你沒能殺掉那隻元素獸。等這場拉克希爾結束，我會親自了結牠。 /// So, you were unable to slay the elemental. I will deal with it myself after Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01396=這些該死的元素獸怎麼來個沒完啊？要是你的戰士應付得來，把牠給我殺了。 /// Is there no end to this elemental vermin? Crush this one if you can spare the warriors to do so.
Conversation/acObj/Line01397=又有一隻元素獸遊蕩到戰場中了。可以的話，解決牠。 /// Yet another elemental has wandered onto the field of battle. Deal with it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01398=我討厭這些可恨的元素獸。如果你有足夠的兵力，殺掉牠們。 /// I hate these detestable elementals. Eliminate them if you have the strength to spare.
Conversation/acObj/Line01401=我是唐尼‧弗米利恩，在佛里迪亞主星的軌道上現場直播。這裡原本是美麗的渡假勝地，現在卻受到無情摧殘。 /// This is Donny Vermillion live in orbit around Veridia Prime: a once beautiful resort, now under assault by nefarious forces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01402=救援計畫是派遣工作單位收集氙能水晶，然後修復環境穩定器。不過事情真有那麼簡單嗎？ /// The plan is to have workers gather xenon crystals to restore the environmental stabilizer. But is that the whole story?
Conversation/acObj/Line01403=好，我們回到直播現場，在佛里迪亞主星的軌道上。維勒安大帝的盟友終於抵達，他們來得及嗎？ /// And we're back, live in orbit around Veridia Prime. Emperor Valerian's allies have finally arrived, but is it already too late?
Conversation/acObj/Line01404=目前的計畫是派遣工作單位收集氙能水晶，然後重新啟動穩定器。行得通嗎？我只能說：行不通。 /// The plan is for workers to gather xenon crystals to reactivate the stabilizer. Will it work? This reporter can only guess, no.
Conversation/acObj/Line01405=佛里迪亞這個渡假勝地曾經是自治聯盟的掌上明珠。而目前的狀況，看來這顆明珠受到了無情的摧殘，而且是熔岩幹的好事。 /// The resort world of Veridia was once a jewel in the Dominion's crown. Today, that jewel has cracked, metaphorically, AND by lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01406=這顆星球唯一的希望，落在兩名指揮官身上。他們的工作單位必須恢復穩定器的動力。我們立刻來看看任務進行得如何。 /// The planet's only hope? Two commanders, whose workers must refuel the stabilizer. Let's join the mission already in progress.
Conversation/acObj/Line01407=稍早之前，佛里迪亞的核心，由於某種未知的敵方科技而產生激烈變化，導致一波又一波的熔岩湧出地表。又有一波馬上要來啦。 /// Earlier an unknown enemy technology destabilized Veridia's core, resulting in endless waves of lava. Another is on its way now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01409=熔岩要升起來了！讓我們祈禱下方的部隊能及時趕到高地。咳咳，最好趕不上，這樣才能提高收視率。 /// The lava is rising! Let's hope the forces down there can reach high ground safely. (aside)Or not. We could use the ratings.
Conversation/acObj/Line01410=地震專家泰瑞指出，地殼活動越來越密集。這代表熔岩又要湧現。時間不多了！ /// This report from Terry, our seismologist, who says seismic activity is increasing. That means lava. And it's coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01411=熔岩來了！各位觀眾，注意低窪地區，那會是最有看頭的地方！ /// Here's the lava! Watch the low ground viewers, that's where the action is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01412=指揮官的工作單位應該很快就會拿到水晶並送往穩定器。我們會在這裡報導整個過程！ /// The commanders' workers should collect the crystals and bring them to the stabilizer soon. We'll be here when they begin!
Conversation/acObj/Line01414=最新消息，環境穩定程度達到百分之二十五。不過前方還有很長的路要走。 /// This just in, the environmental stabilizer is at 25% and holding. Still a long way to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01415=穩定器的動力已經恢復了一半。不過現在慶祝，還嫌太早。 /// The stabilizer has reached the halfway point. But it's still too early for celebration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01416=穩定器的能量來到了百分之七十五。只差一點了，但是尚未結束。他們會圓滿達成任務嗎？ /// The stabilizer is 75% percent charged. So close, yet so far. Will they pull through?
Conversation/acObj/Line01418=再過四分鐘，佛里迪亞就會毀滅。兩位指揮官聽不到我說的話，但是我確定此刻他們都感受到無比的壓力。 /// Four minutes until Veridia's cataclysmic end. They can't hear me, but I'm sure the commanders know the pressure is on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01419=還剩兩分鐘。棚內的氣氛相當凝重，簡直讓我說不出話來了，但為了你們...我...我會繼續播報。 /// Two minutes left. The air in the studio is so thick (faking it)I can barely speak, (faking it harder)but I will... (back to normal)for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01420=只剩一分鐘了！他們必須像是見不到明天的太陽一般瘋狂收集水晶。因為可能真的見不到了。 /// Only one minute left! They need to be loading crystals like there's no tomorrow. Because there might not be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01421=還剩三分鐘。氣氛越來越緊張。 /// Three minutes left. You can feel the tension is building.
Conversation/acObj/Line01422=重大消息！有隻被當地居民稱為「熔蜥」的熔岩蜥蜴被吸引過來了。這將為現場造成難以想像的混亂啦！ /// Breaking news! A Molten Salamander the locals call "Molten Sal" has been drawn to the scene. It could create unimaginable chaos!
Conversation/acObj/Line01423=看來熔岩蜥蜴又出現了。如果指揮官打算要採取行動，現在正是時候。 /// It looks like the Salamander has resurfaced. If the commanders are going to do something, now just might be the time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01424=最新消息，自治聯盟的盟友殺死了這隻瀕臨絕種的生物。難道他們只能採取這種手段嗎？ /// This just in, Dominion allies slay an endangered animal. Was there really no other way?
Conversation/acObj/Line01425=這真是場莫大的災難，個人淺見，我認為維勒安要為此負起所有責任。 /// A crushing defeat, and in my humble opinion, the blame falls squarely upon Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01426=自治聯盟的盟友獲勝了...咳咳，不過把佛里迪亞的天然資源掠奪殆盡，這麼做值得嗎？ /// (surprised)The Dominion's allies are victorious... (recovering)But was plundering Veridia's natural resources worth it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01427=有空中單位被致命的熔岩巨砲給擊中了。我這裡看不到災情，但如果要我猜的話嘛？一定慘不忍睹。 /// Air units caught within a deadly lava spout. I can't see the damage, but if I were to guess? Total devastation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01428=指揮官必須非常小心。有些熔岩噴發的高度甚至能突破平流層，連太空船都可能會被打下來！ /// The commanders need to be careful. Spouts of magma can reach into the upper stratosphere, even taking out spacecraft!
Conversation/acObj/Line01429=熔岩又消退了，簡直來無影去無蹤。現在就看工作單位能不能及時收集到剛剛出現的水晶。 /// As quickly as it surges, the lava recedes. Now it's up to the workers to reach those new crystal formations in time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01430=他們獲勝了？呃...停止連線...這根本毫無新聞價值嘛！什麼？我們還在直播？ /// They won? Cut the feed... I can't use this! What do you mean we're still live?
Conversation/acObj/Line01431=這是場重大的勝利。勇敢的唐尼‧弗米利恩在現場即時報導。這次我一定能得山米新聞獎！ /// A great victory. Thanks to your intrepid reporter, Donny Vermillion. (aside)Bet I get a Sammy award for this one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01432=開始轟隆作響，很快就會湧出熔岩，這一次的規模相當大！ /// The tell-tale rumbling has begun. I expect we'll be seeing a lava surge soon, and a big one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01433=根據地震專家研判，下一波熔岩將會破壞地殼外層...欸，泰瑞，這些科學內容太無聊啦！我唸不下去了啦！ /// Our seismologist believes the coming lava surge is breaching the mantle--Terry, this is boring science stuff! I'm not reading this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01434=地殼活動所引發的地震，撼動著整個佛里迪亞。熔岩緊接著就要出現了！ /// A jolt of seismic activity rocks the surface of Veridia Prime. The lava won't be too far behind!
Conversation/acObj/Line01435=又是一波密集的地殼活動！熔岩又要再次湧現。這次會不會把整顆行星給吞滅呢？ /// Another increase in seismic activity! A lava surge is coming. Will this finally be the big one?
Conversation/acObj/Line01436=地震，代表一件事...熔岩又要再度湧現了！ /// That earthquake only signals one thing... Another lava surge is coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01437=又是地震。熔岩很快又要冒出來了。請繼續鎖定唐尼‧弗米利恩為您帶來的最新消息。 /// Another quake. Another lava surge coming soon. Trust Donny Vermillion to get you the updates you need.
Conversation/acObj/Line01438=我剛收到最新消息...熔岩來了！ /// I've just gotten an update... (dramatic)The lava is here!
Conversation/acObj/Line01439=剛收到最新消息，熔岩即將湧出。請各位收看全星區實況轉播。 /// Word is the lava is hitting now. Let's go live to the planetary feed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01440=熔岩又要湧上來了。希望他們已經在撤離低窪地區的部隊！ /// Another lava surge is here. Evacuation of the low ground had better be underway!
Conversation/acObj/Line01441=我收到報告，熔岩又要湧出來了。立刻轉到六號熔岩攝影機！ /// I'm getting a report that the lava is surging right now. Let's switch to lava cam six!
Conversation/acObj/Line01442=熔岩又要來了...UNN的攝影團隊正在捕捉現場畫面！ /// The lava has arrived once more... and UNN's film crew is on the scene!
Conversation/acObj/Line01443=各位觀眾，熔岩正在吞沒低窪地區。請看現場直播報導。 /// The lava surge is back, viewers. Let's watch as the low ground is engulfed in molten rock and fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01444=看來熔岩已經全部消退。指揮官的工作單位能及時收集到水晶嗎？ /// Looks like the lava has fully receded. Can the commanders' workers make up for the lost time?
Conversation/acObj/Line01445=熔岩再次消退，現場只留下遍地焦痕與水晶。 /// The lava has receded once more, leaving both crystals and destruction in its wake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01446=各位觀眾，熔岩秀結束了！不要轉台，等等還有更精彩的報導！ /// The lava surge is ending, viewers, but stay with us! I'm sure there's a lot more excitement to come!
Conversation/acObj/Line01447=看來熔岩終於消退。我們來看看指揮官在現場的工作狀況。 /// It looks like that surge is finally over with. Let's watch the commanders get back to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01448=消息指出，熔岩退回去了，即將再次回到與時間競賽、重啟穩定器的任務。 /// We're hearing that the lava is receding and the race to reactivate the stabilizer is back on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01449=看來熔岩停止爆發了。等烈焰浪潮再度席捲而來的時候，我們會在這裡為您即時報導。 /// It looks like the surge is over, for now. But when the burning tides rise again, we'll be there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01450=你們聽到轟隆聲了嗎？那是大自然浩瀚無窮的力量。溫度高達四千度，每隔幾分鐘就會升起的死亡熔岩。 /// What's that rumbling? Four thousand degrees of molten death. Surging every few minutes, the lava is truly a force of nature.
Conversation/acObj/Line01451=專家表示，每隔幾分鐘就會湧出的熔岩，會吞噬接觸到的所有事物。那塊低地看來根本是個死亡地帶。 /// Experts say lava surges occur every few minutes, obliterating anything in the way. That low ground is a dangerous place to be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01452=看來熔岩開始上升了！我們快來看看指揮官如何前往高地避難。 /// And it looks like the lava is already rising! Let's watch as the commanders below take refuge upon higher ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01453=我收到消息，熔岩正在上升。希望部隊已經全數撤離低窪地區。 /// I'm getting reports that the lava is surging now. Hopefully the low ground areas have already been cleared.
Conversation/acObj/Line01454=某個指揮官的空中支援單位被噴發的熔岩擊中了。哇賽，這畫面太慘了，我實在不敢看！繼續拍攝，不要停啦！ /// A commander's air support has taken a devastating hit from a lava spout. It's too much to watch! (aside)Of course, keep rolling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01455=被爆發的熔岩直接命中！未成年的觀眾最好閉上眼睛！ /// A direct hit from a lava spout! Younger viewers may want to turn away!
Conversation/acObj/Line01456=我們還在等待工作單位收集水晶，然後送往穩定器。希望一切都還來得及。 /// We're still waiting for workers to collect a crystal and bring it to the stabilizer. Hopefully, things pick up soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01457=按照計畫表，工作單位現在應該要開始收集水晶。這不禁讓人懷疑，維勒安大帝是不是選錯了盟友。 /// The timetable says workers should be collecting crystals by now. Makes you wonder, did Valerian choose the wrong allies?
Conversation/acObj/Line01460=剛收到最新消息，環境穩定程度達到百分之二十五。這表示失敗的機會還高達七成以上。 /// I'm getting word that the environmental stabilizer is now at 25%. Which is still three quarters of a failure.
Conversation/acObj/Line01461=工作單位克服了重重的困難，成功恢復了百分之二十五的動力。這實在是出乎意料的成就。 /// Even with the odds against them, workers have managed to reach 25% stability. A truly unexpected accomplishment.
Conversation/acObj/Line01462=我是唐尼‧弗米利恩，為您報告穩定器已經來到百分之五十。工作單位正卯足了全力要完成任務！ /// This is Donny Vermillion reporting that the stabilizer has reached 50%. Workers are moving as fast as they can!

Conversation/acObj/Line01607=採集艇正遭受攻擊！非常非常嚴重的攻擊！ /// My bots are taking damage! Terrible, terrible damage!
Conversation/acObj/Line01608=有一艘採集艇被毀掉了？現在加派另一艘趕過去也來不及了！ /// They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01611=敵人擊毀一艘採集艇了！等另一艘趕到那裡，湧源都封閉了。 /// The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01612=老兄，那一艘連湧源都沒碰到耶！我根本來不及在湧源關閉前派另一艘過去。 /// Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01618=喂！我可是花了不少功夫耶！要採集態化氫非得靠這些採集艇不可！ /// Hey! I worked hard on that! I need those bots in order to harvest the terrazine, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01619=好吧，有一艘採集艇變成廢鐵了。如果損失太多，就沒辦法繼續採集態化氫了！ /// Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01620=啊！那是我最愛的一艘耶！指揮官，拜託你，一定要好好保護它們！ /// Okay, that was my favorite bot! (Frustrated grunt) Please try to not lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01624=那是什麼聲音啊？喔，原來是我的寶貝採集艇著火啦！再多損失一艘就完蛋了！ /// What's that noise? Oh, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01625=喔不不不！我的採集艇啊！可惡的壞蛋！指揮官，我們不能再損失任何一艘了！ /// No, no, no! Not my bots! You monsters! We can't lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01626=拜託...指揮官，我只剩這幾艘採集艇了，再爆掉就沒戲唱了啦！ /// Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots, commanders! They're all I have left!

Conversation/acObj/Line01629=你看你看！它們回來了！我的寶貝採集艇...哦...還有態化氫！ /// Look, commanders, bots! Oh, those are mine. (Gasps) And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01630=指揮官，跟你報告好消息，採集艇帶著態化氫回來了！嗯，對我來說是好消息。 /// Good news, commanders! My bots have brought me terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01631=咳咳* 指揮官，做得好！採集艇平安回來了。你常接到這種任務嗎？ /// Hey uh, great job, commanders! My bots are safe and sound. Do you do this sort of thing often?
Conversation/acObj/Line01632=萬歲！採集艇平安歸來！貝爾石，看來這場賭局是我贏了！ /// Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet this time, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line01633=採集艇回來了！快來看看我的小氫氫。是態化氫的氫！ /// My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01634=好的開始是成功的一半！不過我需要更多態化氫才能進行研究。 /// We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01635=嗯...進展還不錯。不過還需要更多態化氫才能滿足我的...呃...研究！對！研究！ /// Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to finish my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line01636=啊...目前收集到的態化氫差不多一半了！我要派出更多採集艇！ /// I think I have a little less than half the terrazine I need. I guess I'll be sending out more bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01637=態化氫儲存槽幾乎半滿，貝爾石今天超大方的！我應該寫張卡片感謝她才對... /// My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I should really send her a thank you card...

Conversation/acObj/Line01639=老兄，採集態化氫很辛苦的好不好，我們現在才收集一半而已！ /// Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01640=我快要收集到足夠的態化氫了！加油！指揮官！ /// I've got almost all the terrazine I need! Keep it up, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01641=還差一點點！勝利就在眼前了！嘿嘿嘿嘿！ /// Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line01642=哇，看看這些態化氫！全都是我的！指揮官，只要再一點點就夠了。 /// Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! I need just a tiny bit more, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01643=天啊！這樣我要怎麼完成研究！你知道我在這顆星球上面過得多麼悽慘嗎？ /// Noooo! Now I'll never finish my research! Do you have any idea what I've been through on this planet!? Argh!
Conversation/acObj/Line01644=完蛋了啦！跟我的畢業論文一樣完蛋啦！ /// (Frustrated exertion) It's ruined! It's all ruined! Just like my graduate thesis project!

Conversation/acObj/Line01650=對方直接從翔翼獸身上抽取態化氫！你...要不要去阻止他們啊？指揮官？ /// They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic Bel'shir gliders! You... might want to stop them if you can, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01651=看來他們又抓到一頭翔翼獸了。指揮官，你知道該怎麼做。 /// Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. You know what to do or not do, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01652=天啊，對方真的用活體生物來萃取態化氫。是不是該制止他們呢？ /// Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. Maybe we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01653=對方又抓了一頭翔翼獸來採集態化氫。你能不能去解放牠？ /// Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. Do you think you have the time to set it free?
Conversation/acObj/Line01654=要抽乾翔翼獸身上的態化氫用不了多久，如果你想救牠，動作得快點。 /// The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If you want to save it, you'll have to do it before it's completely drained.
Conversation/acObj/Line01655=呃...再過不久，翔翼獸就要一命嗚呼啦。別忘了牠，被人遺忘的感覺非常差。 /// Uh, we have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. Try not to forget about it. Being forgotten sucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01656=也不是說非得這樣做啦，不過如果你想救那頭翔翼獸，可得加緊腳步了。 /// So, I'm not saying you have to, but if you want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, you don't have all day.

Conversation/acObj/Line01659=指揮官，貝爾石翔翼獸很快就要死掉了，再不快一點就沒機會了。 /// The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world, commanders. You'll miss your chance if you don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01660=好吧，指揮官，那頭翔翼獸快要死了，如果你有打算要救牠的話，要快點喔。 /// Well, you're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death, commanders. If you were ever planning on it, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01661=指揮官，這頭翔翼獸瀕臨死亡，不把握現在就沒機會了。你自己選擇吧。 /// The Bel'shir glider is almost dead, commanders. It's now or never. Literally. You could choose either one.
Conversation/acObj/Line01662=哇喔！你真的讓牠自生自滅啊？我看錯你了。 /// Wow, you really just let that thing die. And I thought I knew you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01663=唉，牠死了。你知道嗎？牠可能是瀕臨絕種的生物。 /// Well, that's one dead whale. It was probably endangered, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01664=那頭生物的態化氫被抽得一滴不剩！貝爾石一定會非常憤怒... /// They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this...
Conversation/acObj/Line01665=那頭生物身上的態化氫被抽乾殆盡，生命隨之消逝！嘖嘖，就跟我的職業生涯一樣悲慘。 /// All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! Tsk tsk. What a tragedy... just like my career.
Conversation/acObj/Line01666=牠得救了！貝爾石非常感謝你！我剛剛是說...我很感謝你。嗯，對，是我很感謝你。 /// You saved it! Bel'shir thanks you, commanders. I mean... I thank you. Yes. Me. With the thanking.
Conversation/acObj/Line01667=真不敢相信，他們居然從那些生物身上抽取態化氫。我怎麼沒想到呢？ /// I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01668=呃...你剛剛有成功救回我們採集到的態化氫嗎？沒有？好吧...沒關係...算了... /// Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
Conversation/acObj/Line01669=我從來沒注意到，原來那些玩意兒一直漂浮在四周。不知道是從哪裡來的。 /// You know, I never noticed those things floating around here before. I wonder where they came from.

Conversation/acObj/Line01671=每次一發動引擎，那些東西就會攻擊我們，如果沒人保護我們，我們永遠沒辦法離開這個星球。 /// Those things attack us whenever we spin up our engines. If you don't protect us while we launch, we'll never get off this rock.

Conversation/acObj/Line01674=現在情勢糟透了，指揮官。開採作業已經沒戲唱了，我們要馬上離開這裡。 /// Everything's gone straight to hell, Commanders. This mining operation is over, and we need to leave right now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01675=沒有你們的保護，那些被感染的傢伙會在我們起飛之前把我們屠殺殆盡的。 /// But without your protection, the infested will tear us apart before we can even take off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01676=我會把船艦的座標傳給你們。你們佈署完成之後，駕駛員就會開始進行起飛程序。 /// I'll send you the coordinates of our ships. If you set up a perimeter at one of them, its pilot will start the launch sequence.
Conversation/acObj/Line01677=這是船艦的位置。每一艘船艦只有在你們的保護範圍內時，才會發動引擎。 /// Here are the locations of our ships. Each one of them will fire up its engines when you're in range to protect it.

Conversation/acObj/Line01687=我欠你們一個大人情啊，指揮官。 /// Can't thank you enough for this, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01688=那艘船和上面乘客的性命都在你們手裡，別讓他們失望了。 /// That ship, and all of its passengers, are in your hands. Don't let them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01689=受感染的人類來了，別讓他們靠近船艦。 /// Incoming infested. Stop them from reaching the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01690=指揮官，有個駕駛員太緊張了，他居然想在毫無防禦的情況下升空。 /// Commanders, one of my pilots is getting antsy. I think he might try to launch without you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01691=有艘船艦情況緊迫，不管有沒有人保護他們，他們都得馬上起飛！ /// I've got a ship that can't wait any longer. They'll be taking off soon, with or without your help.

Conversation/acObj/Line01766=敵方的攻擊部隊在路上了。在他們抵達船艦之前阻止他們。 /// That enemy attack is on its way. Intercept it before it reaches the ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01767=敵人直接往其中一艘船艦進軍了，你得阻止他們。 /// Hostiles are heading directly for one of the ships. You have to stop them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01768=受感染的人類是個問題沒錯，但是亞蒙的部隊是更大的威脅。快解決他們。 /// The infested are one thing, but Amon's forces are an even bigger threat. Take 'em out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01769=敵人朝一艘船艦快速推進，別讓他們得逞。 /// The enemy's making a beeline toward a ship. Don't let them reach it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01770=提醒你，指揮官。有人不請自來了。 /// Heads up, commanders. We've got company coming.
Conversation/acObj/Line01771=他們又去攻擊船艦了，你知道該怎麼做。 /// They're heading for the ship again. You know what to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01772=他們來了，那艘船沒辦法撐太久。 /// Here they come. That ship won't last long against them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01773=敵人要進攻了。他們朝其中一艘船艦過去了。 /// Incoming enemy attack. They're headed for one of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01774=敵人正在移動。指揮官，我們得阻止他們。 /// Enemy's on the move. Gotta put a stop to them, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01775=敵人離開基地了，我們時間不多。 /// The enemy just left their base. We don't have much time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01776=亞蒙的部隊正在逼近，那艘船毫無招架之力。 /// Amon's forces are inbound, and that ship is defenseless.
Conversation/acObj/Line01777=亞蒙的部隊一旦抵達船艦，就會馬上摧毀它 。別讓對方得逞。 /// If Amon's forces reach the ship, they'll destroy it in no time. Do not let that happen.
Conversation/acObj/Line01778=指揮官，那艘船只能坐以待斃。它可承受不住敵人的攻擊。 /// That ship is a sitting duck, commanders. It won't survive an enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01779=敵人正在逼近船艦。你得把握時間阻止他們。 /// Enemy's getting close to a ship. You're running out of time to stop 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01780=一定要阻止敵人進攻，指揮官。他們會把船上的人全部殺光。 /// You have to stop that enemy attack, commanders. They'll kill everyone on that ship.
Conversation/acObj/Line01781=敵軍把我的人當成活靶，已經準備開火了。 /// The enemy's painted a target on my people's back, and they're taking aim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01782=別忘了亞蒙的攻勢。他們破壞船艦的速度比被感染的人類還要快。 /// Don't forget about that enemy attack. It'll wipe out a ship much faster than the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01783=亞蒙的部隊正在逼近，一定要阻止他們。 /// Amon's forces are closing the distance. They have to be stopped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01784=敵人不久之後就會開始攻擊船艦，船上的人們會因此傷亡慘重。 /// Won't be long before the enemy starts attacking the ship, and those people start to die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01785=敵人正在攻擊船艦，快把他們引開！ /// The enemy's attacking the ship. You have to draw their attention away from it!
Conversation/acObj/Line01786=亞蒙的軍隊快把那艘船拆了，船上的人危險了！ /// Amon's forces are destroying the ship. Those people are in danger!
Conversation/acObj/Line01787=船艦遭受攻擊，指揮官，只有你能拯救他們。 /// A ship is under attack. Lives are depending on you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01788=如果你不阻止敵人攻擊的話，船上的人會全部沒命。 /// The people on that ship will get killed if you don't stop that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01789=如果我的人在這波攻擊中喪命，那這些帳都算在你頭上。 /// If my people die to this attack, their blood will be on your hands.
Conversation/acObj/Line01790=那艘船對敵方部隊毫無招架之力。你得出手幫忙才行。 /// That ship stands no chance against an enemy army. You have to intervene.
Conversation/acObj/Line01791=不能再浪費時間了，指揮官！那艘船快被打爛了！ /// Can't waste any more time, commanders! That ship is getting hammered!
Conversation/acObj/Line01792=這可不妙，亞蒙的軍隊會把那艘船撕成碎片。 /// This ain't good. Amon's forces are gonna smash that ship to pieces.
Conversation/acObj/Line01793=我不明白這些傢伙為什麼想殺害我們，但我很慶幸有你們在這裡。 /// Don't know why these guys want us dead, but I'm glad you're here to defend us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01794=太好了，總算少了一件麻煩事。感謝你，指揮官。 /// Well, that's one fewer disaster to worry about. Thank you, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01795=幹得好，現在我們可以專心對付感染者了。 /// Nice work. Now we can focus on the infested again.
Conversation/acObj/Line01796=你們幫那艘船爭取到的一點時間，很可能就是勝負的關鍵。 /// That bought that ship a little more time. It might make all the difference.
Conversation/acObj/Line01797=船上的人都在為你們歡呼。哈，我也是。 /// People on that ship are cheering for you. Hell, so am I.
Conversation/acObj/Line01798=你拯救了許多人的性命，指揮官。我們欠你太多了。 /// You just saved a lot of lives, commanders. We owe you big.
Conversation/acObj/Line01799=希望亞蒙下次動手之前多考慮一下，但他應該沒這麼聰明。 /// Hopefully, Amon'll think twice before trying that again. But I doubt it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01800=我們總算有機會逃出生天了。 /// We just might get out of here alive, after all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01801=真想不到…那群受感染的人類居然解決了亞蒙的部隊。敵人的敵人果然就是朋友。 /// I'll be damned... the infested just took out Amon's forces. Enemy of my enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01802=跟我想的一樣，亞蒙的部隊和受到蟲族感染的人會互相攻擊。 /// As far as I'm concerned, Amon's forces and the infested can go right on killing each other.
Conversation/acObj/Line01803=就算是亞蒙的部隊，也沒辦法輕視受感染的人類。 /// I guess not even Amon's army can ignore the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01804=從來沒想過我會感謝那群受感染的人類。牠們確實化解了敵人的攻勢。 /// Never thought I'd thank the infested for anything. But they sure took care of that enemy attack.
Conversation/acObj/Line01805=受感染的人類消滅了亞蒙的攻擊部隊...我還以為混源體很厲害… /// The infested just destroyed Amon's attack force. And I thought they were dangerous before...
Conversation/acObj/Line01806=我保證過要帶這些人回家…我們得保護好剩下的人。 /// I promised those people I'd get them home safe... We have to protect the others.
Conversation/acObj/Line01807=他們就這樣死了…不能再讓同樣的事發生在其他船上。 /// They're gone... just like that. We can't let the same happen to the rest of the ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01808=我很抱歉。沒時間哀悼了。我們還得盡全力保護其他船艦。 /// Grief has to wait. The other ships must be defended at all costs.
Conversation/acObj/Line01809=不，不要！這樣下去船艦就要不夠了！ /// No, not again! We barely have enough ships as it is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01810=天啊，不！如果我們失去太多船艦，就沒辦法撤離了。 /// Damn it, no! If we lose too many ships, we'll have no way to evacuate.
Conversation/acObj/Line01811=失去太多人了…如果再繼續損失船艦，我的人就完了。 /// So many dead... If we keep losing ships, there's no way we'll survive.
Conversation/acObj/Line01812=我們不能再失去任何船艦了！別讓大家死在這裡，指揮官！ /// We can't afford to lose any more ships! Don't let us die out here, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01813=我…我們只剩這些船艦了。再失去任何一艘，我們就完了。 /// These... these are the last of our ships. We lose another, and we're done for.
Conversation/acObj/Line01814=再失去一艘船艦，就沒辦法把所有生還者都救出去了。 /// Just one more ship lost, and there won't be enough left to save the survivors.
Conversation/acObj/Line01815=我們有個好的開始。繼續保持，就能把所有人都安全救出來。 /// We're off to a good start. Keep it up, and we'll get everyone safely evacuated.
Conversation/acObj/Line01816=有不少人都抵達星軌了，不過我們還有很長的路要走。 /// A fair number of my people have made it to orbit, but we've still got a ways to go.

Conversation/acObj/Line01818=那艘船上的人們都欠你一條命。不過，還有很多船等著要升空。 /// The people on that ship owe you their lives. But there are still a few more to get up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01819=撤離進行得相當順利，指揮官。繼續保護好那些船艦。 /// Evacuation efforts are going well, commanders. Just gotta keep protecting those ships.
Conversation/acObj/Line01820=大概還有一半的人員還沒撤離，就靠你們了。 /// I'd say roughly half of my crew still needs evac. We're counting on you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01821=星球上只剩一些人了，我們快成功了！ /// Just a few of my people are left on the planet. We're almost there!
Conversation/acObj/Line01822=大家幾乎都離開了。再撤離一些人，我們就能離開了。 /// That's almost everyone. Got a few more to evacuate, then we can all get out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01823=守住戰線，指揮官。撤離快完成了。 /// Keep holding the line, commanders. Evacuation is almost complete.
Conversation/acObj/Line01824=我們把那東西叫做禍蟲，是我見過最兇暴的蟲族。有辦法的話，請解決牠吧。 /// We call that thing Blightbringer. Meanest zerg I've ever seen. Might wanna take it out if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01825=那是禍蟲。在感染爆發的時候殺了不少我們的人。有機會的話，幫我們回報牠一下。 /// That's Blightbringer. Killed a lot of us when the infestation started. Return the favor, if you get the chance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01826=受感染的人類很難應付嗎？那禍蟲會讓你更頭痛。可以的話去殺掉它吧。 /// Think the infested are bad? Blightbringer puts 'em to shame. Kill it, if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01827=禍蟲不會一直待在地上。如果你打算解決牠，動作要快。 /// Blightbringer won't stay above ground forever. If you're gonna kill it, you should do it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01828=我不確定你有沒有要解決禍蟲的意思，不過牠似乎要逃走了。 /// Not sure if you wanna deal with Blightbringer, but it looks like it wants to scurry away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01829=禍蟲看來要遁入地底了。如果你想解決牠，就快一點。 /// I think Blightbringer is gonna burrow into the ground. If you wanna squash it, do it fast.
Conversation/acObj/Line01830=禍蟲逃走了。放任牠在外頭撒野讓我蠻擔心的。 /// Blightbringer's made its escape. Makes me nervous knowing it's somewhere out there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01831=你沒有把握機會殺掉禍蟲？沒關係，我比較關心如何活下去這件事情。 /// You didn't get around to killing Blightbringer? Don't worry about it. I'd rather we both live than die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01832=看來禍蟲逃走了。牠要稱霸這整個行星就隨牠去吧。 /// Looks like Blightbringer's gone. It can have this damn planet for all I care.
Conversation/acObj/Line01833=禍蟲死了，幹得太好了。 /// Blightbringer's dead. And good riddance.
Conversation/acObj/Line01834=人死不能復生，但還是要感謝你們替大家復仇。 /// Won't bring back the people it killed, but thank you for at least giving them justice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01835=感謝你，指揮官。我的人沒有足夠的火力對付牠。 /// Thank you for that, commanders. We just didn't have the firepower to deal with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01836=凱爾莫瑞亞提供了我們一些殲滅機，但全都失常了。如果你有辦法解決它們，我會很感謝你。 /// The KMC supplied us with Eradicators, but they've gone haywire. If you could deal with them for us, I'd appreciate it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01837=在疫情爆發的時候，我們的殲滅機就失常了。你們有時間摧毀這些殲滅機嗎？ /// Our Eradicators started malfunctioning as the infestation began. Think you'll have time to destroy them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01838=殲滅機都失控了，它們相當危險。如果你們有辦法的話，請摧毀它們。 /// Those Eradicators are out of control. They could be dangerous. If you can, try to break them down.
Conversation/acObj/Line01839=如果殲滅機回到設施裡面，就再也找不到它們了，想解決它們就趕快行動。 /// If the Eradicators reenter the facility, you won't be able to reach them. You gotta move it if you want to hit them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01840=殲滅機要躲回設施了。如果你們打算處理這個問題，最好快點。 /// The Eradicators are about to return to the facility. If you're going to handle them, do it sooner than later.
Conversation/acObj/Line01841=等到殲滅機回到設施以後，就沒辦法攻擊它們了。想摧毀它們就要盡快行動。 /// You can't attack the Eradicators after they're back in the facility. Hurry up if you want to destroy 'em.
Conversation/acObj/Line01842=殲滅機回到設施裡了。希望它們之後不會把整個行星轟掉。 /// The Eradicators have gone back inside the facility. Really hope they don't blow up the planet or anything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01843=我看到殲滅機已經撤回設施裡面。別管它們了，它們不再是個威脅。 /// Just saw the Eradicators retreat to the facility. Forget about them, they're not a threat anymore.
Conversation/acObj/Line01844=殲滅機離開了。運氣好的話，它們會在我們離開之後才摧毀一切。 /// Eradicators are gone. Maybe if we're lucky, they'll incinerate everything after the evacuation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01845=摧毀殲滅機了。感謝你們，指揮官。我無法想像那些東西會做出什麼事。 /// Eradicators are down. Thank you, commanders. No telling what those things were going to do.
Conversation/acObj/Line01846=我向來不太相信那些玩意兒。那就是凱爾莫瑞亞抄襲尤摩捷科技的後果。 /// Never did trust those things. That's what you get when the KMC tries to copy Umojan tech.
Conversation/acObj/Line01847=你摧毀那些殲滅機了。那些鬼東西根本是在幫倒忙。 /// You've busted up the Eradicators. Damn things did squat to protect us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01848=沒了，最後的希望沒了。我們死定了，指揮官。大家一起等死吧。 /// That was it. That was our last hope. We're dead, commanders. All of us are dead.
Conversation/acObj/Line01849=那些船艦裡的人真是幸運，死得夠痛快。但是我們... /// People in the ships were lucky. They died quick. But the rest of us...
Conversation/acObj/Line01850=那是最後一批人了。指揮官，真是感激不盡，我們全都獲救了。 /// That's the last of us. I can't thank you enough, commanders. You've saved us all.
Conversation/acObj/Line01851=好了，所有人都離開了。現在輪到我們了，感謝你們做的一切，指揮官。 /// Alright, that's everyone. Let's get on out of here! Thank you, commanders. For everything.
Conversation/acObj/Line01852=撤離完成！下面可真是活生生的地獄啊，指揮官。感謝你們把大家救出來。 /// Evacuation's complete! We went through hell down there, commanders. Thank you for getting us out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01853=我們...好餓啊！ /// We... must... feed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01854=混蛋，休想活捉我! /// You'll never take me alive, you bastards!
Conversation/acObj/Line01855=偵測到入侵者！ /// Intruder detected!
Conversation/acObj/Line01856=消滅！消滅！ /// Exterminate! Exterminate!
Conversation/acObj/Line01857=聽好了，指揮官。這裡感染很嚴重。我們需要把這裡燒乾淨，越快越好。 /// Listen up, commanders. We've got a serious level of infestation here, and we need to burn it out STAT.
Conversation/acObj/Line01858=這些怪物在晚上很危險，但一到白天就會被陽光燒得乾乾淨淨。我們得趁機清除受感染的建築。 /// These monsters are dangerous at night, but they burn up during the day. That's when we'll torch the infested structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01859=援軍終於來了！聽著，我想要盡快清除感染的區域，免得擴散到整座星球。 /// Finally, some back up! Look, I need to get rid of this infestation before it spreads to the rest of the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01860=受感染的人類在夜間行動，但牠們沒辦法在日光下存活。善用白天，摧毀牠們的建築。 /// The infested come out at night, but they can't survive the daylight. Use that time to take out their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01861=這星球的狀況很糟。如果感染繼續擴散，任何生物都沒辦法倖存。我們必須阻止感染擴散。 /// This planet is in serious trouble. If this infestation spreads, there won't be any survivors. We need to stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01862=在夜晚行動很危險，不過一到白天，受感染的人類就會死亡。等太陽一昇起就出去燒掉那些建築。 /// It's risky to move at night, but the infested die off during the day. When the sun is up, move out and burn their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01863=指揮官請注意，白天馬上就要結束了，也就是說受感染的人類快出來了。 /// Heads up, commanders. The day's almost over, which means the infested are gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01864=白天快結束了。日落後，受感染的人類就會找上我們。 /// We're almost out of daylight. Once the sun sets, the infested will come knocking on our door.
Conversation/acObj/Line01865=天色暗了。如果我是你，會開始準備對付受感染的人類。 /// Night's almost here. I'd start getting ready to deal with the infested if I were you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01866=白天就要結束了，準備迎接夜晚。 /// Looks like the sun's about to set. Get ready for nightfall.
Conversation/acObj/Line01867=別離開太遠，天色已經很暗了。 /// Don't go out too far. There isn't much time left in the day.

Conversation/acObj/Line01869=又一天過去了。 /// Another day's coming to an end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01870=指揮官，好好利用剩下的時光，快要日落了。 /// Make the most of the day, commanders. It's nearly over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01871=夜晚降臨。準備抵擋受感染的人類。 /// It's almost nighttime. Be ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01872=時間不多了，夜晚來臨時別忘了鞏固基地防禦。 /// Time is running out. Don't forget that our base will need to be defended at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01873=夜晚來臨，指揮官！擊退受感染的人類，想辦法撐到天亮！ /// It's nighttime, commanders! Fight off the infested until daybreak!
Conversation/acObj/Line01874=今天最後一道陽光消失了。我們必須守到日出。 /// That's the last of the sunlight. Our defenses have to hold until the night is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01875=日落了！在太陽升起前，別讓受感染的人類攻陷這裡！ /// The sun is down! Defend against the infested until it rises again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01876=今晚看起來不好過，但我相信能撐過去的。 /// We're in for a rough night, but I know we can survive it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01877=做好準備，指揮官。夜晚才剛開始。 /// Sit tight, commanders. This night's just getting started. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01878=另一個夜晚，另一波攻勢。別讓牠們攻入基地。 /// Another night, another fight. Keep them out of our base!
Conversation/acObj/Line01879=外頭好多死人...我可不想加入牠們。 /// A lot of dead out there. Make sure that we don't join them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01880=我聽說感染狀況很嚴重，但這太誇張了！擋住牠們！ /// I knew the infestation was bad, but this is crazy! Hold them off!
Conversation/acObj/Line01881=繼續戰鬥，指揮官。我們能撐過今晚的。 /// Just keep fighting, commanders. We'll make it through the night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01882=受感染的人類來了。我們必須撐到日出。 /// Here come the infested. We have to hold them off until sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01883=太陽隨時都會升起。牠們馬上就會化為灰燼。 /// The sun will rise any minute now. Then the infested will burn away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01884=再撐一下子，指揮官。陽光會消滅這群受感染的人類。 /// Just a little longer, commanders. The infested can't survive in the sun.
Conversation/acObj/Line01885=夜晚快結束了，等到白天我們就可以安全行動。 /// The night's almost over. We'll be safe to move out again in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01886=我們辦得到的，指揮官，天就快亮了。 /// We can do this, commanders. It's almost sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01887=加油！夜晚快結束了！ /// Keep it up! Night's coming to an end soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01888=牠們也只有現在可以為所欲為，很快就換我們進攻了。 /// The infested can attack us all they want. Soon, it's gonna be our turn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01889=我知道情況看起來很糟，但就快結束了。天快亮了。 /// This may look bad, but it won't last much longer. Morning's almost here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01890=黎明就要來臨，堅守陣地！ /// Daybreak is just around the corner. Hold the line until then!
Conversation/acObj/Line01891=別放棄，指揮官。夢魘就要結束了。 /// Don't give up, commanders. This nightmare is about to end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01892=我們只要再撐一下子，撐到天亮就好。 /// It won't be long now. We just have to survive until dawn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01893=指揮官，你知道現在是晚上嗎？受感染的人類隨時都會出現！ /// You sure you want to do that at night, commanders? The infested will be here any minute!
Conversation/acObj/Line01894=指揮官，我喜歡你積極的態度，但我不建議這麼做。在白天比較容易摧毀建築。 /// I like the hustle, but I'd advise against it, commanders. It'll be easier to take out the structures in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01895=別太冒險。如果我們沒守住基地，整座星球都會被感染。 /// Don't get too bold out there. If our base falls to the infested, this planet will be lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01896=馬上傳給你其他建築的座標。 /// Sending you the coordinates for more structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01897=我偵測到其他區域的建築物。 /// I've got another sector with structures on my scanners.
Conversation/acObj/Line01898=工作還沒結束，指揮官。這裡還有些建築必須燒毀。 /// We're not done yet, commanders. Here are some more structures to burn out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01899=這裡好像有更多建築。 /// Looks like we can find additional structures here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01900=我在這裡偵測到更多建築。 /// Detecting more structures at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01901=亞蒙。可惡。看來只有擊潰他的部隊，才能抵達建築。 /// Ugh. Amon. Great. Looks like we have to fight through his forces to get to the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01902=亞蒙的部隊不斷阻止我們接近建築，別讓他們得逞！ /// Amon's forces are trying to keep us away from the structures. Don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01903=偵測到敵方部隊接近建築。 /// I'm picking up hostile forces headed for the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01904=所以我們得同時面對亞蒙的部隊和受感染的人類？不太妙... /// So we have to fight Amon's forces AND the infested? This just keeps getting better...
Conversation/acObj/Line01905=不可思議，亞蒙的部隊居然在保護那些建築。消滅牠們！ /// I can't believe Amon's forces are trying to protect those structures. Take them out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01906=小心，那些追獵蟲行動迅速，而且很會跳！ /// Look out for those hunterlings. They're fast, and boy can they JUMP.
Conversation/acObj/Line01907=追獵蟲來了！牠們可以跳過懸崖，小心。 /// Incoming hunterlings! They're cliff jumpers, so watch out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01908=是追獵蟲！牠們速度很快，而且可以在懸崖之間跳躍！ /// Hunterlings! Those things move fast, and they can jump up cliffs!
Conversation/acObj/Line01909=這些東西叫爆酸蟲，牠們會噴吐強酸，死掉時還會爆炸。 /// We call these ones "kaboomers." They spit acid, and they explode when they die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01910=記得與爆酸蟲保持距離，牠們會叫這個名字是有原因的。 /// Keep your distance from those kaboomers. We call them that for a reason, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01911=陸戰隊把牠們稱為爆酸蟲，牠們會噴強酸，但爆炸的時候更可怕。 /// The marines named these ones "kaboomers." The acid spit is bad enough, but just wait until they explode.
Conversation/acObj/Line01912=是窒殺蟲，一不注意就會被牠們拉過去，並且陷入昏迷。 /// Chokers. They'll pull in your forces and stun them if they aren't dealt with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01913=窒殺蟲很危險，牠們會抓走獵物，然後用毒素使其昏迷。 /// Those chokers are bad news. They'll pull in their prey and stun them with their toxins.
Conversation/acObj/Line01914=小心窒殺蟲，牠們會把你的部隊抓走、弄暈，然後殺死。 /// Beware of those chokers. They'll stun and kill your forces after pulling them in.
Conversation/acObj/Line01915=空中有監視蟲，快趁牠們還沒造成威脅時打下來。 /// Spotters are in the air. Shoot them down before they become a problem.
Conversation/acObj/Line01916=偵測到監視蟲，牠們有飛行能力，最好小心點。 /// Detecting some spotters. They can fly, so you better keep an eye on them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01917=空中出現監視蟲，請盡快處理。 /// The infested have spotters in the sky. You should probably deal with them soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01918=臭氣蟲？！這些東西不怕日光！我們得親自把牠們殺死。 /// A stank!? Those things are resistant to sunlight! We have to be the ones to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01919=臭氣蟲很強壯，白天也可以行動。我們只能親手殺死牠們。 /// That stank is strong enough to withstand sunlight. We have to kill it ourselves.
Conversation/acObj/Line01920=噢，拜託別是臭氣蟲！不快點消滅牠的話，牠就會不斷攻擊，就算是白天也一樣。 /// Oh no, not a stank! If we don't kill it, it'll keep attacking us even after sunrise!
Conversation/acObj/Line01921=我們的路障受到強烈攻擊。 /// One of our barricades is being hit hard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01922=受感染的人類想穿過路障。 /// The infested are trying to break through one of our barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01923=路障被攻擊了！ /// A barricade is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line01924=我們的路障正遭受攻擊。 /// We've got a barricade taking some damage here.

Conversation/acObj/Line01964=如果你今晚沒除掉噬病毒的話也別緊張，我相信明天晚上它還會出現的。 /// Don't worry if you can't kill the virophage tonight. I'm sure it'll be back tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01965=做得好，指揮官。這樣我們清除建築之後就不用擔心噬病毒了。 /// Nice job, commanders. Now we don't have to worry about the virophage after we clear out the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01966=你們幫了我一個大忙，指揮官。我原本想等到完成這個任務之後再派人去清除那個東西。 /// You just saved me a lot of trouble, commanders. I was going to send a crew to exterminate that thing after this mission.

Conversation/acObj/Line01980=說真的，我很佩服你。從今天的戰果看來，我得修改明天的預期目標。 /// I have to say, I'm impressed. I'll revise the estimate for tomorrow based on what you've done today.

Conversation/acObj/Line02271=指揮官，這區搞定了。你們爭取到了一點時間。 /// That sector's gone. You've bought yourselves a little more time, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line02272=嗯，這區現在什麼都不剩了。戰爭基地要花更長的時間才能發動攻擊。 /// Well, there's nothing left of that sector. Now it'll take 'em longer to fire the battle station.
Conversation/acObj/Line02273=爆破成功，我們順利拖延他們啟動戰爭基地武器的時間了。 /// Demolition complete, and we've delayed them from activating the battle station's weapons.
Conversation/acObj/Line02274=很好，只剩三個區域要處理。 /// Happy to say we only have three sectors left.
Conversation/acObj/Line02275=好，這樣就只剩下三個區域。 /// Okay, this leaves us with three more sectors to destroy.
Conversation/acObj/Line02276=你還需要把運輸車送往剩下兩個區域。 /// You'll still need to get trucks to two more sectors.
Conversation/acObj/Line02277=還有兩個區域需要摧毀。 /// There are two additional sectors to detonate.
Conversation/acObj/Line02278=加把勁，最後一個區域了。 /// Hang in there. Just one sector left. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02279=只剩一個區域，我們辦得到！ /// One more sector to go. We can do this!
Conversation/acObj/Line02280=提醒一下，我們完成這項任務的時間有限。 /// Friendly reminder--we only have so long to finish off the sectors.

Conversation/acObj/Line02283=快沒時間了，指揮官！ /// Almost outta time, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line02284=馬上移動運輸車！ /// Move those trucks, now!

Conversation/acObj/Line02310=運輸車上的神器可以讓石像失效，這就像是以毒攻毒一樣。 /// The artifacts in your truck will disarm this construct--like fighting fire with fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line02311=把載滿神器的運輸車送往石像，石像就會關閉，我保證。 /// Bring your truck full of artifacts to this construct, and it'll shut down, I promise.
Conversation/acObj/Line02312=運輸車上的貨物會讓石像失去功能。開過去就對了。 /// Your truck's cargo will neutralize this construct. Just drive it over.
Conversation/acObj/Line02313=你再不把運輸車開過去的話，石像會讓你有大麻煩。 /// That construct's gonna cause a whole heap of trouble unless you bring a truck here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02314=快把運輸車引導到石像那邊，不然你的部隊會全部被殺光！ /// Get your truck to the construct before it melts through your forces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02315=指揮官，把運輸車開到石像旁邊，不要拖太久。 /// Don't wait too long to get your truck to this construct, commanders.

Conversation/acObj/Line02321=你辦到了！石像現在變成一堆石塊了。 /// You did it! The construct's just rubble now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02322=莫比斯部隊在這個平台上建立了戰爭基地。我們必須在他們攻擊殖民地之前，先下手為強，摧毀各個區域。 /// Moebius Corps constructed a battle station on this platform. We're gonna have to take out each sector of it before it fires on our colonies.
Conversation/acObj/Line02323=這些運輸車上的薩爾納加神器，會干擾莫比斯的科技，不過你要先把它們移動到正確的地方。 /// These trucks carry xel'naga artifacts that'll destabilize Moebius' technology, but first you'll have to move them into position.
Conversation/acObj/Line02324=莫比斯部隊在這個平台上打造了戰爭基地。我們要分區擊破它。 /// Moebius Corps built a battle station on this platform, and we're gonna have to dismantle it sector by sector.

Conversation/acObj/Line02326=我從來沒見過這樣的戰爭基地。看來莫比斯採用了別的科技，只有薩爾納加神器可以影響它。 /// I've never seen a battle station like this. Moebius tech is something else--only xel'naga artifacts seem to affect it.

Conversation/acObj/Line02329=你知道嗎…有更多石像來阻止你了，別讓它們得逞。 /// What do you know... more constructs are trying to deter you. Don't let 'em succeed.
Conversation/acObj/Line02330=前方有敵人出現。解決那些石像，才有辦法抵達爆破點。 /// You've got some company up ahead. Take down those constructs to access the demolition point.
Conversation/acObj/Line02331=你必須先清掉爆破點的石像，運輸車才有辦法就定位。 /// You'll have to clear these constructs off the demolition point to get your trucks in there.
Conversation/acObj/Line02332=那些石像就擋在爆破點上面！轟爛它們！ /// Those constructs are on the demolition point! Blow 'em up!
Conversation/acObj/Line02333=我們沒成功趕到研究哨站，但是他們還是停止傳送資料了。不知道是為什麼？ /// We didn't make it to the research outpost, but they stopped broadcasting anyway. I wonder why?
Conversation/acObj/Line02334=哈，研究哨站看來沒辦法收到訊號了。危機解除。 /// Huh. The research outposts seem to have had trouble getting a signal after all. Crisis averted.
Conversation/acObj/Line02335=你一定不會相信，哨站沒動靜了。那…應該是好事吧？ /// You're not gonna believe this. The outposts just went silent. That's good... I think? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02336=「傳送者為TheSkunk和Pr0nogo。」我很好奇它是做什麼用的？ /// "Teleportation by TheSkunk and Pr0nogo." I wonder how it works?
Conversation/acObj/Line02337=好了，蓋瑞。你可以張開眼睛了。驚喜嗎？我帶你回貝爾石慶祝生日。這裡就是你出生的地方。 /// Okay, Gary. You can open your eyes now. Surprise! I brought you back to Bel'shir for your birthday. This is where you were born.
Conversation/acObj/Line02338=對了...嗯...既然我們的態化氫快用完了，乾脆我們就來採集態化氫吧？這一定很好玩！我還會讓你幫忙喔！ /// And... uh... since we're here and my terrazine supplies are low, why don't we harvest some more? It'll be fun! I'll even let you help!
Conversation/acObj/Line02339=啊，終於。我們又回到貝爾石了。你也跟我一樣想念這裡嗎，蓋瑞？噓！別這麼說。貝爾石會聽見的，我們需要她的幫忙才能有態化氫。 /// Here we are. Back on Bel'shir. Did you miss it as much as I did, Gary? (beat) Hey! Don't say that. Bel'shir might hear you, and we need her help to get more terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line02340=好，看來舊裝備大部分都還在。我們有很多工作要做，所以我需要你來幫忙，小心別搞砸了。 /// Okay. It looks like most of the old equipment is still intact. There's a lot to do and I need your help, so don't screw this up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02341=喔，偉大的貝爾石，你的忠實僕人伊崗回來了。呃，我知道我們很久沒見了，但是我真的需要更多態化氫。 /// Oh great Bel'shir, your faithful servant Egon has returned. Look, I know it's been a while, but I could really use some more terrazine. Please?
Conversation/acObj/Line02342=我還把蓋瑞和一些其他的朋友都帶來了。他們會幫我採集態化氫。蓋瑞！蓋瑞！快和貝爾石說你很想念她！ /// I even brought Gary and some other friends along. They're going to help me with the harvesting. (whispering to Gary) Gary! Gary! Tell Bel'shir that you missed her!
Conversation/acObj/Line02343=看來湧源快要噴發了！我會叫蓋瑞馬上派採集艇出發。 /// Looks like a geyser's about to become active! I'll have Gary send one of the bots for it shortly.
Conversation/acObj/Line02344=第一座湧源就快噴發了。到時候，我會叫蓋瑞派採集艇去開採。 /// The first geyser should be opening up soon. I'll have Gary send a bot out for it when it does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02345=喔，我找到一座快要噴發的湧源了。蓋瑞會派採集艇去開採，但是我們得護送那個小傢伙。 /// Ooh, I've located a soon-to-be active geyser. Gary will send a bot to harvest it, but we need to escort the little fella.
Conversation/acObj/Line02346=貝爾石說又有湧源可以開採了。蓋瑞，如果你聽不到她說話也沒關係。只要你今天好好表現一下，說不定她就會跟你說話了。 /// Bel'shir says that some more geysers are opening up soon. Don't worry if you can't hear her, Gary. If you prove yourself today, maybe she'll talk to you too.
Conversation/acObj/Line02347=湧源要噴發了。別問我是怎麼知道的，蓋瑞。我...就是知道啦。 /// Geysers are gonna be active soon. (beat, annoyed) Don't ask me how I know that, Gary. I just... do.
Conversation/acObj/Line02348=嗯，看來又快要有湧源了。噢，貝爾石在跟我說她想念我啦！ /// Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. Aww, this is Bel'shir saying that she missed me!
Conversation/acObj/Line02349=又有湧源要噴發了。快點開心跳舞吧，蓋瑞！ /// Some geysers are gonna be opening in a few moments. Do your happy dance, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02350=你知道我要說什麼，對吧？嗯？又有湧源可以開採了，對吧對吧？不要偷偷讀我的心，蓋瑞！ /// You know what I'm about to say, right, eh? That there are more geysers on the way? Get out of my head, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02351=看來這是最後的湧源了。就快結束了，蓋瑞！ /// Looks like this is the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02352=嘿！注意！第一台採集艇要出發了。我們要保護它！它是我第二喜歡的...呃...第一名當然是蓋瑞囉。 /// Hey! Heads up! The first bot is going out. We must protect it! It's my second favorite... after Gary, of course.
Conversation/acObj/Line02353=好，蓋瑞派了一台採集艇去開採湧源的態化氫，我也派我的機甲蟲群到處巡邏了，但是你還是得提高警覺，看有沒有壞蛋來搗蛋！ /// Okay, Gary sent a bot out to collect the geyser's terrazine. I've got my mecha-swarm on the prowl, but keep your eyes open in case you spot any bad guys!
Conversation/acObj/Line02354=我的採集艇要出發了。夜色很黑而且到處都是態化氫，所以我們得確保它能平安回來。 /// My bot is departing now. The night is dark and full of terrazine, so let's make sure it comes back in one piece.
Conversation/acObj/Line02355=採集艇要上路囉！小心照顧好它們。 /// Bots are on their way! Let's keep them out of trouble.
Conversation/acObj/Line02356=我最棒的採集艇要出發了！呃，當然不包括你囉，蓋瑞。你是最棒棒的。 /// The best of my bots are going out! Well, not counting you, Gary. You're in a league of your own.
Conversation/acObj/Line02357=我的採集艇想去找態化氫了。它們不像你那麼有耐心，蓋瑞，所以你可以放它們出來囉。 /// My bots really want to get to the terrazine. They're not as patient as you, Gary, so you can let them out now.
Conversation/acObj/Line02358=採集艇出花！哈哈哈哈！怎麼啦？別掃興嘛，蓋瑞。每次我這樣講，貝爾石都笑到不行的說！ /// Bots away! (Laughs at his own joke) What? Don't be a party pooper, Gary. Bel'shir laughs every time I tell it!
Conversation/acObj/Line02359=雖然其他的採集艇不像蓋瑞那麼完美，但並不表示我不愛它們。如果你能幫我好好保護它們，我會很感激你的。 /// Look, just because these other bots aren't as perfect as Gary doesn't mean I don't love them. I'd appreciate it if you help me keep them safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02360=我覺得這些採集艇想告訴我們，它們要出發了，但也有可能是我搞錯了。上次在這裡的時候它們就騙過我，這些小壞蛋！ /// I think the bots are telling us they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They lied to me the last time I was here, those little miscreants!
Conversation/acObj/Line02361=採集艇出發了！嗚...和上次見到它們的時候比起來，它們長大好多喔！爸比愛你們喔！ /// There go the bots! (Sniffs) They've grown up so much since the last time I saw them! Daddy loves you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02362=看那些採集艇出發的樣子！要是能把它們升級成「超級採集艇」就更棒了...唉，不過那樣的話，蓋瑞會吃醋的。 /// Look at the bots go! They'd be even better if I upgraded them into Super Harvesters... (sigh, frustrated) but Gary will get jealous if I do that. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02363=我的採集艇正在開採態化氫。別鬆懈！在它完工之前，我們必須保護它。 /// My bot is collecting the terrazine now. Pay attention! We have to defend it until it's done.
Conversation/acObj/Line02364=好，開始採集態化氫。蓋瑞，盯緊採集艇的工作進度，不然你就要倒大楣了！ /// Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Gary, make sure the bot does its job or I will hold you accountable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02365=他們要攻擊我的採集艇了！我們要阻止他們！ /// They're coming after my bots! We need to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line02366=啊，壞蛋來了！但這次我有新朋友可以跟他們「打招呼」。 /// Gah, here come the bad guys! At least this time I have some new friends to say "Hello."
Conversation/acObj/Line02367=不好了！我偵測到敵人朝採集艇移動了！ /// Uh oh! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line02368=敵人顯然想攻擊我的採集艇。我們一定要阻止他們！ /// The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. We CANNOT let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line02369=喔，這下真是太棒了！敵人朝我的採集艇移動了。早知道我就叫蓋瑞在採集艇上多放幾個砲台！ /// Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have told Gary to put more turrets on those things!
Conversation/acObj/Line02370=抱歉啦，壞蛋們，貝爾石今天打烊啦！你們最好把東西收一收，滾回老家去吧。 /// Sorry, bad guys, Bel'shir is closed today! You better pack it up and get outta here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02371=採集艇要回去了。我們要繼續保護它，直到它回去為止。 /// The harvesting bot is returning now. We'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line02372=採集艇要回去了。它有點怕怕的，我們還是一起回去吧。 /// The bot is heading back. It's scared, so we should keep it company.
Conversation/acObj/Line02373=態化氫採集成功！現在採集艇得要安全回家才行。給它一點精神上的支持，蓋瑞！ /// A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely. Give it some emotional support, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02374=準備回家囉，小採集艇！我和我的朋友們會保護你！ /// Come on home, little bots! Me and my friends will protect you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02375=好，採集艇應該在回家的路上了。我的態化氫快用光了，我需要更多的態化氫...來做我的...實驗。 /// Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I'm low on terrazine and I need a new supply... for my... experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line02376=採集艇要回家了。我都不用擔心它們。不像「某個」機械小跟班，它的名字我就不提了。咳...蓋瑞...咳。 /// The bots are returning now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike a CERTAIN robot companion, whom I will not name. (cough) Gary. (cough)
Conversation/acObj/Line02377=態化氫儲存槽裝滿了！我的採集艇準備要回家了。我們跟緊一點，保護好它們！ /// Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Let's stay close so we can keep them safe!
Conversation/acObj/Line02378=採集艇賽跑開始！哪一台採集艇會先回到我身邊呢？喔，蓋瑞，別吃醋啦。這只是好玩而已。我還是會把最棒的機油留給你的。 /// And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (beat) Don't get jealous, Gary. It's just a game. I still keep the best oil for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02379=採集艇要回基地了。我們得小心點，叢林法則是很殘酷的！而且…我們真的在叢林。 /// My bots are heading back to base. We have to be careful. It's a jungle out there! Oh... it is.
Conversation/acObj/Line02380=喂！喂！他們在攻擊採集艇！我們要想點辦法！ /// Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! We need to do something! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02381=早安，我的朋友！敵人快把我的採集艇打爛啦，小心下一個就是你！我們得想辦法阻止他們！ /// Good morning, friends! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast! Unless YOU want to be next, we need to do something!
Conversation/acObj/Line02382=敵人在攻擊我的採集艇！蓋瑞，你怎麼沒有警告我們啊？ /// The enemy's attacking my bots! Why didn't you warn us about this, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02383=敵方部隊全都衝向我的採集艇了！我得叫我的機甲蟲群去幫忙才行！ /// Enemy forces have converged on my bots! I'll get my mecha-swarm in there!
Conversation/acObj/Line02384=那些傢伙快把我的採集艇都打碎啦！我真的不想跟上次在這裡的時候一樣，最後還得撿個半死！ /// Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them like the last time I was here!
Conversation/acObj/Line02385=我的採集艇受到攻擊了！而且這次是真的，真的不是我的幻覺啦！ /// My bots are under attack! And no, I am NOT hallucinating this time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02386=這個，嗯...沒什麼事...才怪啦！敵人快把我的採集艇打成破銅爛鐵啦！ /// So, uh... everything's fine here... except for the fact that the enemy is smashing my bots to pieces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02387=蓋瑞，快看！你的兄弟姊妹回來了！而且他們把態化氫帶回來了！ /// Look, Gary, your brothers and sisters are back! And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02388=蓋瑞，好消息！採集艇把態化氫帶回來了！呃，至少對我來說是好消息。 /// Good news, Gary! Our bots have brought us terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02389=採集艇回來啦！就算過了這麼久，它們還是很可靠的！ /// The bots have returned! Even after all this time, they can still get the job done! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02390=呼！我的採集艇回來了！看來這局又是我贏了，貝爾石！ /// Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet AGAIN, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line02391=嘿，朋友們，你們聽到了嗎？沒錯，那就是我寶貴的採集艇被打爆的聲音！再損失一台，我們就完蛋了！ /// Hey, friends, you hear that? Yeah, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line02392=喔，拜託！我不能再失去採集艇了！不然我就要叫蓋瑞去採集態化氫，然後我們就要因為工作分配的問題大吵一架了... /// Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots! Then I'll have to ask Gary to harvest the terrazine, and we'll get into this big argument about job responsibilities...
Conversation/acObj/Line02393=我們的態化氫存量有了好的開始！但是還需要更多的態化氫，才能彌補我之前用掉的。 /// We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But it's gonna take a lot more to replace what I've already used.
Conversation/acObj/Line02394=嗯，看來我們有進展了。我們還需要更多的態化氫來繼續我的...呃...研究，沒錯！ /// Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to continue my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line02395=為什麼有人需要這麼多的態化氫？你覺得呢？當然是為了...科學囉！ /// What does anyone need this much terrazine for, you ask? Science, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line02396=我的態化氫儲存槽快裝滿一半了。貝爾石今天真大方！我猜她一定很想念我... /// My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I guess she missed me...
Conversation/acObj/Line02397=喔，看看那些態化氫！它們全都是我的！呃...我們的...我是說我們的。 /// Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! Ours... I mean it's all ours.
Conversation/acObj/Line02398=我的態化氫快收集完了...我是說，我們的！當然，我當然會分給大家啦。哈哈哈...呃...大家加油！ /// We've got almost all the terrazine I need... I mean, we need! Because, of course, I'll share some. (nervous laughter) Uh... let's keep it up, friends!
Conversation/acObj/Line02399=我應該說態化氫儲存槽空了快一半，還是說裝了快一半呢？嗯...反正裝滿就對了！ /// Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line02400=什麼？他們在從貝爾石的動物身上吸取態化氫！蓋瑞，你說該怎麼辦？我們要去救那些動物嗎？ /// Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Gary, what do you think? Should we free it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02401=敵人正在從貝爾石的翔翼獸身上吸取態化氫！蓋瑞，這是測試你有沒有同理心的最好機會。你會怎麼做呢？ /// The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! This is a great chance to test your empathy, Gary. What would you do? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02402=他們正在從美麗的翔翼獸身上直接採集態化氫！如果我們去救那些翔翼獸，貝爾石一定會很高興的。 /// They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic gliders! If we save it, Bel'shir will be very happy with us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02403=看來他們又抓到一頭翔翼獸了。蓋瑞，這次該怎麼做呢？ /// Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. What'll it be this time, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02404=呃，他們真的下定決心要執行從生物採集態化氫的計畫了。你覺得我們應該阻止他們嗎？ /// Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. You think we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02405=他們又抓了一頭翔翼獸來採集態化氫。我覺得...牠在跟我求救。 /// Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. It's crying out to me for help... I think.
Conversation/acObj/Line02406=要抽乾翔翼獸身上的態化氫用不了多久。如果我們想救牠，動作得快點！ /// The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If we're gonna save it, we have to do it now!
Conversation/acObj/Line02407=我們只剩一點時間可以救翔翼獸了。蓋瑞，牠的生命就要結束了，你有什麼感想？ /// We have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. How does the creature's impending doom make you feel, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02408=如果我們想救那頭翔翼獸，就不能再拖拖拉拉了。 /// If we want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, we don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line02409=貝爾石希望我們去救那頭翔翼獸。如果我們袖手旁觀，她可能會...你知道的，用她的神聖力量懲罰我們。 /// Bel'shir would appreciate it if we saved that glider. If we don't do something, she might, you know, punish us with her divine power.
Conversation/acObj/Line02410=二開根號的十次方等於...沒錯！根據計算，那頭貝爾石翔翼獸很快就會死亡。我們快沒時間了。 /// (Mumbles calculations to himself) By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. We don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02411=那頭翔翼獸就要死掉了，我們再不行動就沒機會了。 /// The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world. We'll miss our chance if we don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02412=好吧，看來沒什麼機會救那頭翔翼獸了。我們就放著牠不管嗎？ /// Well, we're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death. Are we just gonna ignore it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02413=這頭翔翼獸就要死了。蓋瑞，你會怎麼做？你的答案可能會決定我以後要不要相信你。 /// The Bel'shir glider is almost dead. What would you do, Gary? The answer you give will probably determine whether I ever trust you again.
Conversation/acObj/Line02414=好吧，那頭翔翼獸死了。蓋瑞，你看起來「完全」不在乎。我要再對你做一次「基準測試」嗎？ /// Well, the glider's dead. Gary, you don't look concerned about that AT ALL. Do I need to do another Baseline Test on you?
Conversation/acObj/Line02415=哎呀，我們就這樣讓牠死了，對吧？呃...但至少態化氫的存量還在增加。 /// Oops. We kind of just let that thing die, didn't we? Um... but at least the terrazine supplies are filling up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02416=嗯，牠死透了。呃...好吧。待會我可以分析牠的屍體，然後做出一個機械化的版本。 /// Well, that's one dead whale. Ah well. I can analyze the remains later and make a mechanized version of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02417=他們把那頭翔翼獸徹底抽乾了！貝爾石一定會超生氣...而且她會把怒氣都發洩在我們身上。 /// They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this... and she will direct her wrath at all of us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02418=那頭翔翼獸的態化氫被抽光了，牠的生命也沒了！喔，「現在」你才想哭嗎，蓋瑞？你的動作也太慢了吧。 /// All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! (beat) Oh, NOW you're crying, Gary? A lot of good that does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02419=我們救了牠！哈哈哈！貝爾石對我們非常滿意，朋友們。沒錯，當然也包括你，蓋瑞。我告訴她你也覺得這是個好主意。 /// We saved it! Bel'shir is very happy with us, friends. Yes, even you, Gary. I told her that you thought it was a good idea.
Conversation/acObj/Line02420=蓋瑞，謝謝你支持我們要救翔翼獸的決定。我還擔心你是個冷血、殘酷的殺人狂呢。呵呵。 /// Thanks for supporting our choice to save that thing, Gary. I was getting a little worried you might be a cold, merciless psychopath. (nervous laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02421=蓋瑞，很高興知道你因為救了翔翼獸所以開心。以後晚上睡覺的時候，我就不用把你關起來了。 /// I'm glad you're happy that we saved that thing, Gary. Now I don't have to restrain you when I sleep at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line02422=不！浪費那麼多態化氫，貝爾石會要人出來負責的。蓋瑞，那個人就是你了！ /// Noooo! Bel'shir will demand a sacrificial offering after wasting all that terrazine. I'm looking at you, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02423=幹的好，太漂亮了。那麼多的態化氫就這樣...沒了！什麼？你是在怪我嗎，蓋瑞？你真是太過分了！ /// (Sarcastic) Nice job. Real nice. All that terrazine just... gone! (beat) What? You're blaming ME, Gary? You're unbelievable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02424=嘿！嘿！話可別亂說喔，蓋瑞。這可不是我的錯...至少這次不是。 /// Hey! Hey! Watch your mouth, Gary. That was NOT my fault... not this time, at least.
Conversation/acObj/Line02425=不不不！我怎麼老是把事情搞砸...但還是那麼棒呢？ /// No, no, no! (sigh) How can I be so bad at everything I try, and still be so great?
Conversation/acObj/Line02426=太好了，貝爾石。謝謝妳送給我這麼棒的態化氫禮物。蓋瑞！要有禮貌，快說「謝謝」。 /// Oh great Bel'shir. Thank you for this wonderful gift of terrazine. (whispering to Gary) Gary! Don't be rude. Say "thank you."
Conversation/acObj/Line02427=各位朋友，我們成功了！你們知道這代表什麼嗎？沒錯，我不用拆掉蓋瑞然後重做一個新的好朋友了！ /// We did it, friends! You know what that means? (very cheerful) That's right--I don't have to disassemble Gary and build a new best friend!
Conversation/acObj/Line02428=做的好，蓋瑞！你越來越厲害了。說不定下一次我會讓你操控我的機甲蟲群喔。 /// Great work, Gary! You're really getting the hang of this. Next time maybe I'll let you control my mecha-swarm.
Conversation/acObj/Line02429=大家做的太棒了！蓋瑞做的也很棒，對不對啊？為了獎勵蓋瑞，我要幫他打造一個新朋友，就叫她...葛瑞塔好了！ /// Excellent work, everyone! And didn't Gary do great? Just for that, I'm gonna build him a new friend. I'll call her Gretta! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02430=聽見了嗎？態化氫正在地底下流動。哦呵，更多湧源要噴發了。 /// Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/acObj/Line02431=偵測到地殼活動！這代表一件事...哈哈！更多湧源！ /// Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02432=如果我是賭徒我一定會立刻下注，賭更多湧源馬上就要出現。如果...呵呵...我的口袋裡還有錢的話。 /// If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Conversation/acObj/Line02433=湧源即將噴發，跟全能的貝爾石之神所預言的一樣！快點準備！ /// The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Conversation/acObj/Line02434=這是最後一波了！只剩下我...孤孤單單地留在宇宙的深處終老一生... /// These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Conversation/acObj/Line02435=這應該是最後一批可用的湧源了！事情越來越有趣了。 /// These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line02436=喂！採集艇就要出發啦！我根本來不及幫它們裝上備用燃料槽！ /// Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Conversation/acObj/Line02437=採集艇該回來了。它們每次在外面過夜都不打通電話，讓我超擔心的。 /// Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line02438=態化氫...採集開始！這要花點時間才行，所以請耐心等候啦！ /// Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Conversation/acObj/Line02439=我偵測到有敵軍正往我的寶貝採集艇前進！他們真的很想要態化氫。 /// I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line02440=敵軍朝我的小寶貝過來了！這群混帳！ /// Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Conversation/acObj/Line02441=敵軍出動了！他們就不能讓我好好完成實驗嗎？ /// Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?

Conversation/acObj/Line02446=採集艇回來了！快來看看我的小氫氫。是態化氫的氫！ /// My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02447=老兄，採集態化氫很辛苦的好不好，我們現在才收集一半而已！ /// Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line02448=還差一點點！勝利就在眼前了！嘿嘿嘿嘿！ /// Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02449=真不敢相信，他們居然從那些生物身上抽取態化氫。我怎麼沒想到呢？ /// I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line02450=啟動～採集程序。要不了多久，整個貝爾石的態化氫都會是我的了！哇哈哈哈哈！ /// Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Conversation/acObj/Line02451=開始進行採集。請你耐心等候，這個處理過程非常複雜的。 /// Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02452=態化氫真的是我的小氫氫！哈哈哈！啊？沒反應？沒幽默感耶。 /// This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/acObj/Line02453=採集時間到！來看看今年的態化氫收成量有多少。 /// Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Conversation/acObj/Line02454=採集艇正在溫柔的抽...取態化氫。要是弄痛了貝爾石，她會不高興的。 /// My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02455=哇靠..居然直接躍傳到我的採集艇旁邊？我早該料到神族會用這招的... /// Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Conversation/acObj/Line02456=敵人直接躍傳到採集艇旁邊？他們作弊！ /// They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Conversation/acObj/Line02457=敵方發射空投艙...也就是說...呃...他們從上面攻過來啦！快保護採集艇！ /// Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02458=敵方空投艙逼近！天要塌啦！天要塌下來啦！ /// Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Conversation/acObj/Line02459=他們降落在採集艇旁邊！呼，至少不是直接砸在上面。 /// They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02460=蟲族...蟲族從天上掉下來啦！快點保護採集艇！ /// It's raining zerg! Death from above! Save the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02461=蟲族直接降落在採集艇旁邊！牠們到底有多少隻利維坦啦？ /// The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Conversation/acObj/Line02462=是蟲族的空投囊！牠們直接朝採集艇衝過去了！ /// Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02463=那是什麼啦？看起來像是虛空破壞獸！原來真的有這個東西！ /// What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Conversation/acObj/Line02464=虛空破壞獸？出現在這裡？我還以為牠們只是假設性的生物！ /// A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Conversation/acObj/Line02465=不...不可能不可能...那是虛空破壞獸？拜託，告訴我這不是真的！ /// No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Conversation/acObj/Line02466=這些虛空破壞獸就像是惡夢一樣。對我來說真的是惡夢。 /// Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line02467=哇喔！那是混源體嗎？我已經很久沒遇過牠們了！真是太棒了！ /// Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line02468=混源體耶！這代表自治聯盟的基因接合技術足以生產混源體了嗎？ /// A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line02469=那個...好像是混源體。我還記得牠們有多恐怖...這下糟糕了。 /// That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line02470=對方又派出其他混源體了！我真想去培育牠們的設施好好觀摩一下。 /// More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line02471=這些混源體跟我以前見過的不太一樣。能不能留個全屍讓我研究一下？ /// These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Conversation/acObj/Line02472=敵方混源體出動了！不知道牠們會不會對態化氫過敏... /// Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Conversation/acObj/Line02473=有一艘採集艇被毀掉了？現在加派另一艘趕過去也來不及了！ /// They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02474=敵人擊毀一艘採集艇了！等另一艘趕到那裡，湧源都封閉了。 /// The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02475=老兄，那一艘連湧源都沒碰到耶！我根本來不及在湧源關閉前派另一艘過去。 /// Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line02476=好吧，有一艘採集艇變成廢鐵了。如果損失太多，就沒辦法繼續採集態化氫了！ /// Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
