Conversation/acObj/Line01059=不少穿梭机逃走了。要是再继续下去，我们的努力将化为泡影。 /// Quite a few shuttles have warped away. If this continues, our efforts will be for naught.
Conversation/acObj/Line01060=逃跑的穿梭机数量非常惊人。指挥官们，必须守住最后的防线。 /// The number of escaped shuttles is alarming. Commanders, the line must be held.

Conversation/acObj/Line01309=我们都知道这是不能容忍的。我必须赢得这场挑战。为此，我需要你和你盟友双方来为我提供灵能支援。 /// We both know this cannot stand. I must win this challenge, and to do that I need both you and your ally to support me psionically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01310=高阶领主，我若是想要击败挑战者，必须要有两支部队同时助阵。你们必须派你们双方的部队来帮我。 /// It will take more than one army's power for me to overcome this challenger, Highlord. You must both commit your forces to me.
Conversation/acObj/Line01311=只有一支部队来帮我是怎么回事？如果你们将我弃之于不顾，他们下一个要挑战的就是你，高阶领主。 /// Is there some reason only one army is offering me support? If you allow me to fail here, they will challenge you next, Highlord.
Conversation/acObj/Line01312=没有两支部队的支援，我无法打败这位挑战者。助我获胜才最符合你的利益，阿拉纳克。 /// Without support from both armies, I will be unable to defeat this challenger. It's in your interest to assure my victory, Alarak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01313=虽然你很信任我的能力，但我必须提醒你，我需要你们双方部队的灵能支援才能获胜。 /// Despite your confidence in my abilities, I must remind you that I require psionic support from both armies in order to win.

Conversation/acObj/Line01332=你们击溃了敌人的支援力量，当然也损失了不少战士，不过我相信你们能应付得过来。 /// You've broken the enemy's support. It cost you a few warriors, but no doubt you'll manage.
Conversation/acObj/Line01333=敌人出现了严重失误。他们的勇士已经孤立无援了。 /// The enemy has made a grievous error. Their champion has lost his support.
Conversation/acObj/Line01334=真是大胆的战术，阿拉纳克。敌人消灭得非常干脆彻底。 /// A bold stratagem, Alarak. Brutally efficient at eliminating the enemy.
Conversation/acObj/Line01335=埃蒙一派横扫了你们的部队，高阶领主。别忘了再强大的升格之链也有最薄弱的一环。 /// Amon's forces have wiped out your army, Highlord. Remember that the Chain of Ascension is only as strong as its weakest link.
Conversation/acObj/Line01336=我知道这并不是你全部的实力，阿拉纳克。如果你还想维持塔达林的等级秩序，就赶紧派你的精锐力量。 /// I know this is not the full extent of your power, Alarak. Send me your best if you wish to maintain order within the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01337=看来你低估了你的对手。我会把你的这一特点铭记在心。但现在，我需要增援。 /// It seems you've underestimated your opponent. I will keep that tendency in mind. But for now, I require reinforcements.

Conversation/acObj/Line01339=难道你晋升之后就荒废了技艺吗？还是说你也想置我于死地？如果我输了，你也就没有了塔达林。 /// Has your strength waned since your ascension? Or are you trying to eliminate me as well? Win this fight, or lose the Tal'darim.
Conversation/acObj/Line01340=我通知你来参加这场挑战不是为了让你当观众的，阿拉纳克。我需要你的部队提供灵能支持。 /// I did not inform you of this challenge so you could spectate, Alarak. I require psionic support from your army.
Conversation/acObj/Line01341=高阶领主，如果你还想控制塔达林就必须助我取胜。快派你的部队支援我，不能再拖了。 /// Highlord, I must be victorious if you are to keep hold of the Tal'darim. Send your forces to support me without delay.

Conversation/acObj/Line01344=难道要我提醒你，你的任务是支援我吗？如果你想看到我被扔进坑里，那你就亲自动手吧。 /// Need I remind you that your objective is to support me? If you wish to see me thrown into the pit, then do it yourself.
Conversation/acObj/Line01354=我正在不断丧失领地，高阶领主。你和你的盟友必须支援我，除非你希望你的领导权被剥夺。 /// I am losing ground, Highlord. You and your ally must support me, unless you wish your command to be usurped.
Conversation/acObj/Line01355=阿拉纳克，你这点帮助完全不够。难道你故意有所保留吗？快派增援给我，以便我能重新夺回失地。 /// I expected more from you than this, Alarak. Are you intentionally holding back? Send me support so I can regain lost ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01356=局势已经对我不利了，高阶领主。如果你再不采取措施，你的领导权也会崩溃。 /// The tide turns against me, Highlord. If you do not intervene with additional support, it will erode your rule as well.
Conversation/acObj/Line01357=高阶领主，我离献祭深渊不远了。你必须立即支援我，否则埃蒙就会重新控制塔达林！ /// Highlord, I am nearly upon the pit of sacrifice. You must support me now, or Amon will be poised to conquer the Tal'darim anew!
Conversation/acObj/Line01358=我已经能看到深渊了，阿拉纳克。快支援我！我不能死在这里！ /// I am within sight of the pit, Alarak. Support me now! I must not be defeated here!

Conversation/acObj/Line01379=你失败了，高阶领主！你一路机关算尽到头来得到了什么？你还是失去了塔达林！ /// You have failed, Highlord! All those incessant machinations, and for what? You have lost the Tal'darim!
Conversation/acObj/Line01380=你对塔达林的统治又延续了一天，高阶领主。看来领导权的更迭之日尚未到来。 /// Your rule of the Tal'darim holds for another day, Highlord. It seems the time for leadership to change is not yet upon us.

Conversation/acObj/Line01395=所以，你们没能消灭元素生物。等拉克希尔结束后，我亲自动手。 /// So, you were unable to slay the elemental. I will deal with it myself after Rak'shir.
Conversation/acObj/Line01396=怎么又是这只元素生物？如果你们有空闲的部队，就赶紧解决它！ /// Is there no end to this elemental vermin? Crush this one if you can spare the warriors to do so.

Conversation/acObj/Line01407=稍早之前，维丽蒂亚的核心遭到了一种未知的敌方科技破坏，引发了连续不断的岩浆潮。眼下，又一波爆发就要来了。 /// Earlier an unknown enemy technology destabilized Veridia's core, resulting in endless waves of lava. Another is on its way now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01409=岩浆涌上来了！但愿下方的部队能够及时赶到高地。最好赶不上，这样才能提高收视率。 /// The lava is rising! Let's hope the forces down there can reach high ground safely. (aside)Or not. We could use the ratings.
Conversation/acObj/Line01410=我们的地震专家特里传来报告说，地震活跃度正在增强。这意味岩浆马上就要来了！ /// This report from Terry, our seismologist, who says seismic activity is increasing. That means lava. And it's coming soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01411=岩浆来了！观众们注意看低洼地带，那里将会是最大的看点！ /// Here's the lava! Watch the low ground viewers, that's where the action is!
Conversation/acObj/Line01412=指挥官们的工人们应该很快就会拿到水晶并送到稳定装置那里。等他们开始后，我们会在这里为您报道整个过程！ /// The commanders' workers should collect the crystals and bring them to the stabilizer soon. We'll be here when they begin!
Conversation/acObj/Line01414=最新消息，环境稳定装置已恢复25%，并且状态稳定。不过还有很长的一段路要走。 /// This just in, the environmental stabilizer is at 25% and holding. Still a long way to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01415=稳定装置已经恢复过半了。不过，现在就庆祝恐怕为时尚早。 /// The stabilizer has reached the halfway point. But it's still too early for celebration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01416=稳定装置已经充能75%。只差最后一点点了。他们能坚持过来吗？ /// The stabilizer is 75% percent charged. So close, yet so far. Will they pull through?
Conversation/acObj/Line01418=再过四分钟，维丽蒂亚就会彻底毁灭。两位指挥官听不见我说的话，但我敢肯定他们此刻都感受到无比的压力。 /// Four minutes until Veridia's cataclysmic end. They can't hear me, but I'm sure the commanders know the pressure is on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01419=时间只有两分钟了。演播室里的氛围相当凝重，我都快说不出话来了，但是为了你们，我……必须坚持报道。 /// Two minutes left. The air in the studio is so thick (faking it)I can barely speak, (faking it harder)but I will... (back to normal)for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01420=还剩一分钟！这下他们必须要像是见不到明天的太阳一样拼命了。因为很可能真的见不到了。 /// Only one minute left! They need to be loading crystals like there's no tomorrow. Because there might not be.

Conversation/acObj/Line01423=好像巨蜥又出现了。如果指挥官们准备采取什么行动的话，现在正是时候。 /// It looks like the Salamander has resurfaced. If the commanders are going to do something, now just might be the time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01424=插播一条消息，帝国盟军杀害了一只濒危动物。难道他们只会使用这种极端手段吗？ /// This just in, Dominion allies slay an endangered animal. Was there really no other way?
Conversation/acObj/Line01425=依鄙人之见，这是一场可怕的灾难，瓦伦里安必须为此承担全部责任。 /// A crushing defeat, and in my humble opinion, the blame falls squarely upon Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01426=帝国的盟军获胜了……不过把维丽蒂亚的自然资源掠夺殆尽，这么做值得吗？ /// (surprised)The Dominion's allies are victorious... (recovering)But was plundering Veridia's natural resources worth it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01427=有空中单位被致命的岩浆喷发给击中了。具体伤亡情况尚不了解，不过硬要猜的话？恐怕惨不忍睹。 /// Air units caught within a deadly lava spout. I can't see the damage, but if I were to guess? Total devastation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01428=指挥官们要当心了。有些岩浆喷发的高度甚至会突破平流层，即便是太空船也有可能会被击毁。 /// The commanders need to be careful. Spouts of magma can reach into the upper stratosphere, even taking out spacecraft!
Conversation/acObj/Line01429=岩浆潮来得快去得也快。现在就看工人们能否及时地挖到那些新出现的水晶了。 /// As quickly as it surges, the lava recedes. Now it's up to the workers to reach those new crystal formations in time.
Conversation/acObj/Line01430=他们赢了？切掉画面……这种新闻毫无价值！什么叫我们还在直播？ /// They won? Cut the feed... I can't use this! What do you mean we're still live?

Conversation/acObj/Line01432=征兆性的轰隆声出现了。岩浆很快就要爆发了，这次规模还不小！ /// The tell-tale rumbling has begun. I expect we'll be seeing a lava surge soon, and a big one!
Conversation/acObj/Line01433=我们的地震专家认为下一波岩浆爆发将会突破地幔层——特里，这些科学内容太无聊了！我不想读了！ /// Our seismologist believes the coming lava surge is breaching the mantle--Terry, this is boring science stuff! I'm not reading this!
Conversation/acObj/Line01434=地震活动所引发的震感，撼动着维丽蒂亚主星的地表。岩浆紧接着就要出现了！ /// A jolt of seismic activity rocks the surface of Veridia Prime. The lava won't be too far behind!

Conversation/acObj/Line01443=观众们，岩浆又冲上来了。我们来看看低洼地带被熔岩与火焰吞噬的一幕吧。 /// The lava surge is back, viewers. Let's watch as the low ground is engulfed in molten rock and fire.
Conversation/acObj/Line01444=岩浆好像完全消退了。指挥官们手下的工人们能否赢回损失的时间呢？ /// Looks like the lava has fully receded. Can the commanders' workers make up for the lost time?
Conversation/acObj/Line01445=岩浆又消退了，其所经之处只剩下一片焦痕与水晶。 /// The lava has receded once more, leaving both crystals and destruction in its wake.
Conversation/acObj/Line01446=岩浆潮快要退了，但千万不要走开，观众们！我敢肯定一会儿还会有更刺激的场面！ /// The lava surge is ending, viewers, but stay with us! I'm sure there's a lot more excitement to come!
Conversation/acObj/Line01447=这波爆发应该是彻底结束了。我们来看看指挥官们返回工作的现场画面吧。 /// It looks like that surge is finally over with. Let's watch the commanders get back to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01448=有消息说岩浆正在下沉。重启稳定装置的行动即将继续展开。 /// We're hearing that the lava is receding and the race to reactivate the stabilizer is back on.
Conversation/acObj/Line01449=这场喷发应该暂时结束了。等烈焰浪潮再度席卷而来的时候，我们会在第一时间进行现场报道。 /// It looks like the surge is over, for now. But when the burning tides rise again, we'll be there.
Conversation/acObj/Line01450=你们听到轰隆声了吗？那是大自然的力量。四千多度的熔岩，每隔几分钟就会喷发一次。 /// What's that rumbling? Four thousand degrees of molten death. Surging every few minutes, the lava is truly a force of nature.
Conversation/acObj/Line01451=专家们说岩浆每隔几分钟就会喷发一次，会熔化其所接触到的任何东西。地势低洼地区简直就是死亡地带。 /// Experts say lava surges occur every few minutes, obliterating anything in the way. That low ground is a dangerous place to be.
Conversation/acObj/Line01452=看样子岩浆已经涌上来了！我们看看下方的指挥官们能否到高地上躲过一劫。 /// And it looks like the lava is already rising! Let's watch as the commanders below take refuge upon higher ground.
Conversation/acObj/Line01453=我接到报告说，岩浆正在喷涌。但愿低洼地势的人群已经被疏散了。 /// I'm getting reports that the lava is surging now. Hopefully the low ground areas have already been cleared.
Conversation/acObj/Line01454=有位指挥官的空中支援单位被喷发的岩浆给击中了。画面太惨了，我不敢看！继续拍摄，画面不要停！ /// A commander's air support has taken a devastating hit from a lava spout. It's too much to watch! (aside)Of course, keep rolling!
Conversation/acObj/Line01455=被一处岩浆喷口直接命中！未成年的观众们最好闭上眼睛！ /// A direct hit from a lava spout! Younger viewers may want to turn away!
Conversation/acObj/Line01456=我们还在等待工人们收集水晶，然后送往稳定装置。但愿计划能赶上进度。 /// We're still waiting for workers to collect a crystal and bring it to the stabilizer. Hopefully, things pick up soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01457=从时间表上来看，工人们这会儿应该开始收集水晶了。这不禁让人怀疑，瓦伦里安大帝是不是选错盟友了？ /// The timetable says workers should be collecting crystals by now. Makes you wonder, did Valerian choose the wrong allies?
Conversation/acObj/Line01460=我收到消息说，环境稳定装置现在已经恢复了25%。也就是说还有75%的失败几率。 /// I'm getting word that the environmental stabilizer is now at 25%. Which is still three quarters of a failure.
Conversation/acObj/Line01461=尽管困难重重，工人们还是成功恢复了25%的稳定性。实在是一项超乎预料的成就。 /// Even with the odds against them, workers have managed to reach 25% stability. A truly unexpected accomplishment.
Conversation/acObj/Line01462=这里是多尼·沃米里安正在为您播报，稳定装置现在已经恢复了50%。工人们正在开足马力进行抢修！ /// This is Donny Vermillion reporting that the stabilizer has reached 50%. Workers are moving as fast as they can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01463=环境稳定装置的恢复状态已经过半。这是一次属于下方一线部队的伟大瞬间。 /// The environmental stabilizer has reached the halfway point. A big moment for the forces down below.
Conversation/acObj/Line01464=距离稳定装置完全恢复只剩25%了。但是他们还来得及吗？ /// Only 25% remains 'til the stabilizer is charged. But is there enough time left?
Conversation/acObj/Line01465=难以置信，稳定装置即将充能完毕！他们能成功吗？我会继续为大家进行追踪报道！ /// Beyond all belief, the stabilizer is nearly charged! Can they make it? I'll be here to find out!

Conversation/acObj/Line01471=只剩三分钟了，不知道指挥官们这会儿脑子里在想什么呢？犹豫？还是恐惧？恐怕两者都有。 /// With three minutes remaining, you have to wonder what's going through the commanders' minds? Fear? Doubt? Likely both.
Conversation/acObj/Line01472=前方传来了新的消息，他们只剩两分钟的时间了。但愿他们能加快进度。 /// Updated reports indicate they've reached the two-minute mark. Hopefully they start working faster.

Conversation/acObj/Line01475=只剩最后一分钟了。生命中的……最后……六十秒。UNN独家报道。 /// There's one minute left. One single... solitary... minute. (aside)Brought to you by UNN.
Conversation/acObj/Line01476=岩浆里出现了一只熔岩巨蜥！环境保护人士们声称它们已经濒临灭绝，可现在谁才是处境最危险的呢？ /// A Molten Salamander has emerged from the lava! Conservationists say they're endangered, but who's in danger now?
Conversation/acObj/Line01477=一只被岩浆激怒的熔岩巨蜥正在袭击城镇区域。我们会想办法看看能不能给个近距离的特写镜头！ /// A Molten Salamander agitated by the lava is attacking the downtown area. We're going to see if we can get a closer shot!
Conversation/acObj/Line01478=巨蜥又出现了。我通常不会在报道中掺杂个人意见，但是那家伙看上去很生气。 /// The Salamander has resurfaced. I normally don't editorialize, but that thing looks angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01479=熔岩巨蜥出现的时候，通常四周到处都是火焰。帝国的盟军会采取措施吗，还是决定放任那家伙不管？ /// Flames spread as the Molten Salamander resurfaces. Will the Dominion's allies intervene, or leave this creature unchecked?
Conversation/acObj/Line01480=虽然“火蜥”被灭绝了，但是它对这座美丽的城市做出的贡献，将被我们永远铭记。 /// While Molten Sal is no more, its contributions to this fair city will never be forgotten.
Conversation/acObj/Line01481=就在今天，“火蜥”被帝国盟军残忍地杀害了，这不禁让我们思考……谁才是真正的喷火怪兽？ /// Molten Sal was brutally slain by Dominion allies today, leaving many to wonder... who was the real fire-breathing monster?
Conversation/acObj/Line01482=会不会是皇帝的盟军们没有使出全力？答案是肯定的。瓦伦里安，你难辞其咎。 /// Could the Emperor's allies have done more? The answer is yes. Thanks Valerian.
Conversation/acObj/Line01483=一次可怕的失败。这场悲剧肯定会成为瓦伦里安政权永远也无法抹去的一大污点。 /// A devastating loss. This will surely haunt Emperor Valerian to the end of his reign.
Conversation/acObj/Line01484=噢，观众们，快看。指挥官们需要极其小心翼翼地飞行来规避熔岩喷发的岩浆柱。 /// Oh, watch this, viewers. The commanders are going to need to fly carefully to avoid the magma spouts bursting from the lava.
Conversation/acObj/Line01485=他们好像正在飞越岩浆上方。在那些随时都有可能喷发的岩浆喷口面前，那还真是一次大胆的举动。他们知道有这回事吧？ /// Looks like they're flying over the lava. That's a bold move with those lava spouts. (aside)They know about the lava spouts, right?
Conversation/acObj/Line01493=噢，太可怕了……一个鲜活的生命就这样在我们眼前消失了。但愿其他人能承担起他的工作。 /// Oh, the horror... a worker has died before our very eyes. Hopefully another can carry on their work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01494=有位指挥官刚刚损失了一名工人，珍贵的物资掉落在现场。能拿回来吗？他们还有希望吗？ /// A commander just lost a worker, dropping their precious cargo. Can it be recovered? Or is all hope already lost?

Conversation/acObj/Line01499=岩浆消退了……而且还留下了一些水晶。指挥官们必须要赶在下一波岩浆到来之前搜集它们。 /// The lava is receding... and it's left behind some crystals. The commanders will be trying to gather those before the lava sweeps them away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01500=退去的岩浆好像留下了一些水晶。为了维丽蒂亚，但愿工人们能及时地去搜集它们。 /// Looks like the receding lava has left behind crystals. For Veridia's sake, let's hope the workers gather those quickly.
Conversation/acObj/Line01501=退去的岩浆似乎淘出了一些水晶。如果走运的话，工人们会很快地把它们送往稳定装置那里。 /// It appears the receding lava has unearthed some crystals. With any luck, workers will get them to the stabilizer quickly.

Conversation/acObj/Line01504=还有岩浆？马上就要来了？少来了。承认吧，你就是想刷存在感，特里。 /// More lava? Coming soon? I don't believe you. Admit it, you're desperate for attention, Terry.
Conversation/acObj/Line01505=又一波岩浆潮来了！我们先放一段赞助商的广告，随后继续为大家呈上更多的报道。 /// Another lava surge has come! We'll have more after this short message from our sponsor.

Conversation/acObj/Line01511=第一块水晶已经交付了，不过这只是稍微推迟了一点点我称之为“毁灭倒计时”的时间而已！ /// The first crystal has been turned in, putting a little more time on what I'm calling "the countdown to destruction!"
Conversation/acObj/Line01512=随着工人们不断地交付水晶，稳定装置，呃，正在变得稳定……不过这也只是稍微拖延了一下即将到来的毁灭。 /// As the workers turn in crystals, the stabilizer, uh, stabilizes... prolonging the coming doom by a few more moments.
Conversation/acObj/Line01513=给稳定装置带来一块水晶为他们争取了些许时间。不过要完全恢复这颗星球的创伤，这还远远不够。 /// Bringing a crystal to the stabilizer has bought them some time. But it will take more than time to heal this planet's wounds.
Conversation/acObj/Line01514=各位指挥官？你们真的……存在？抱歉，我在这里待得太久了，这些地嗪……熏得我脑子有点乱！……很乱。 /// Commanders? Are you... are you real? Sorry, I've been here a while, and the terrazine... Not the best for my sanity! (Nervous laugh) ...It's not.
Conversation/acObj/Line01515=如果你们真的存在，那么能帮我个忙吗？外面有人一直在骚扰我的采集机器人。 /// In case you ARE real, someone out there has been messing with my harvesting bots. Would you mind keeping an eye on them for me?

Conversation/acObj/Line01526=嗯，看情况马上就会有更多的气泉要出现了。拜舍尔总是能给出你想要的答案！ /// Hmm, looks like there will be more geysers soon. You can always count on Bel'shir to provide what you need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01527=探测到地震活动！这只说明了一件事：马上就有更多的气泉了！ /// Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers!
Conversation/acObj/Line01528=如果谁敢跟我赌一把，我会把钱全押在马上要出现更多气泉上面。如果，我是说，如果我有钱的话。 /// If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.

Conversation/acObj/Line01533=看样子这些是最后一批气泉了。结局临近了，指挥官们！ /// Looks like these are the last set of geysers. The end is nigh, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01534=这些应该就是最后一批气泉了！可惜我才刚刚觉得好玩呢。 /// These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line01535=嘿！注意了！我正在派出我的首个机器人。一定要保护好它！它可是我最得意的一个。 /// Hey! Heads up! I'm sending out the first bot. Make sure to protect it! It's my favorite.
Conversation/acObj/Line01536=好吧，我这就派个机器人过去搜集气泉的地嗪。一定要保护好它！ /// Okay, I'm sending a bot to collect the geyser's terrazine. Don't let it get destroyed!

Conversation/acObj/Line01569=啊，坏蛋来了！呃，他们是谁来着？ /// Gah, here come the bad guys! Uh, who are they, again?
Conversation/acObj/Line01570=我发现一些敌方部队朝我的机器人扑过去了。他们这么想要那些地嗪啊。 /// I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.

Conversation/acObj/Line01591=噢，顺便说一下，指挥官们，周围好像出现了更多的虚空撕裂者。我只是跟你们说一声！ /// Oh by the way commanders, there seem to be more Void Thrashers around. Just keeping you informed!
Conversation/acObj/Line01592=那些虚空撕裂者是噩梦里才会有的东西。确切地说，是我的梦。 /// Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line01593=噢，那是混合体吗？我还从没见过这种东西！真是神奇！ /// Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line01594=是混合体！难道帝国已经掌握了创造它们的基因剪接技术？ /// A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line01595=那东西……看上去是个混合体哎。在我的印象里，它们可是非常可怕的东西。 /// That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line01596=有更多混合体来了。我真想看一眼培育它们的各种参数啊。 /// More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line01597=这些混合体和我之前见过的不一样。任务结束后，能不能让我研究一下它们？ /// These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?

Conversation/acObj/Line01611=敌人打掉了一个机器人！我来不及派另一个机器人赶过去，那处气泉就会自己关闭的。 /// The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01612=不是吧，那个机器人甚至都没有看清气泉长什么样！这下在气泉消失之前，我没办法再派另一台机器人过去了。 /// Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line01618=嘿！那玩意可花了我不少心血啊！我需要那些机器人才能采集地嗪，指挥官们！ /// Hey! I worked hard on that! I need those bots in order to harvest the terrazine, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01619=呃，我的机器人挂了一个。如果挂得太多的话，我就没办法再采集地嗪了！ /// Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01620=天呐，那可是我最喜欢的机器人啊！我真的不想再看到这样悲伤的一幕了，指挥官们！ /// Okay, that was my favorite bot! (Frustrated grunt) Please try to not lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01624=那是什么噪音？噢，我宝贵的机器人烧起来了！我的心在滴血！ /// What's that noise? Oh, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01625=不不不！不要再伤害我的机器人！你们这些怪物！我们不能再有任何损失了，指挥官们！ /// No, no, no! Not my bots! You monsters! We can't lose any more of them, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01626=噢，拜托！再损失机器人我可真的承受不起了，指挥官们！现在只剩它们了！ /// Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots, commanders! They're all I have left!

Conversation/acObj/Line01632=呼！我的机器人回来了！这次好像我赌赢了，拜舍尔！ /// Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet this time, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line01633=我的机器人回来啦！没有我想的那么难嘛，手到“嗪”来啊！ /// My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line01634=我们开局不错，拿到一罐地嗪！但是我的研究还需要更多。 /// We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But my research is going to require some more.
Conversation/acObj/Line01635=嗯，我们进展还不错。不过要完成我的研究……还需要更多的地嗪，没错！ /// Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to finish my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line01636=我到手的地嗪已经离要求差不多快一半了。我猜我该派出更多的机器人了！ /// I think I have a little less than half the terrazine I need. I guess I'll be sending out more bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line01637=我的地嗪罐差不多满一半了。拜舍尔今天真是大方！我真该给她寄上一张感谢卡…… /// My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I should really send her a thank you card...
Conversation/acObj/Line01638=我的地嗪罐到底有一半是空的呢，还是有一半是满的呢？嗨，把它们全都装满这个就不是问题了！ /// Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line01639=兄弟，采集地嗪很辛苦的。我们现在才采集了一半的量！ /// Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line01640=我所需要的地嗪马上就够了！再加把劲儿，指挥官们！ /// I've got almost all the terrazine I need! Keep it up, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01641=再差那么一点就够了！胜利已经离我们近在咫尺！ /// Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line01642=噢，快看这满满的地嗪！全都是我的！不过我还需要那么一点点，指挥官们。 /// Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! I need just a tiny bit more, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01643=不！！！这下我永远也无法完成我的研究了！你们知道我在这颗星球上是怎么熬过来的吗！？呃啊！！！ /// Noooo! Now I'll never finish my research! Do you have any idea what I've been through on this planet!? Argh!
Conversation/acObj/Line01644=完了！这下全完了！我的毕业论文也没戏了！ /// (Frustrated exertion) It's ruined! It's all ruined! Just like my graduate thesis project!
Conversation/acObj/Line01645=太棒了！我终于可以完成这项研究，离开这个鸟不拉屎的鬼地方了！噢抱歉，拜舍尔！我不是那个意思！ /// Yes! I can finally finish this research and get off this godforsaken rock! (Beat) I'm sorry, Bel'shir! I didn't mean it like that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01646=研究完成。哈哈，这感觉好爽！我都快笑出声了。还是说正事吧，我们赶紧离开这个鬼地方。 /// Research complete. Haha, that was pretty good! I crack me up. But seriously, let's get the hell out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01647=干得漂亮，指挥官们！你们今天为科学界做出了重大的贡献。现在，呃……能想个办法带我离开这里吗？ /// Nice work, commanders! You've done science a great service today. Now uhh... any chance I could get a ride off world?
Conversation/acObj/Line01648=不是吧？他们正在从拜舍尔的动物身上吸取地嗪！指挥官们，如果可以的话最好救一下它！ /// Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Commanders, try to free it if you can!
Conversation/acObj/Line01649=太过分了！敌人正在从拜舍尔的鲸鸟身上抽取地嗪！必须阻止他们！或者算了，你们决定吧。 /// This is an outrage! The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! We have to stop them! Or not, your choice.
Conversation/acObj/Line01650=他们正在直接从巨型的拜舍尔鲸鸟身上提取地嗪！如果可以的话……最好阻止一下他们，指挥官们。 /// They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic Bel'shir gliders! You... might want to stop them if you can, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01651=看样子他们又困住了另一只拜舍尔鲸鸟。指挥官们，你们知道该做什么，或者不该做什么！ /// Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. You know what to do or not do, commanders!
Conversation/acObj/Line01652=不好了，他们正在加倍从活物身上提取地嗪。我觉得我们应该阻止一下？ /// Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. Maybe we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line01653=又一只拜舍尔鲸鸟正在惨遭毒手。你们有时间去救救它吗？ /// Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. Do you think you have the time to set it free?
Conversation/acObj/Line01654=拜舍尔鲸鸟的地嗪可不是永远也吸不完的。如果你们还有点同情心的话，最好赶在它被吸干之前做点什么。 /// The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If you want to save it, you'll have to do it before it's completely drained.
Conversation/acObj/Line01655=呃，要去拯救拜舍尔鲸鸟可以，但是我们的时间非常有限。千万不要忘了这一点。我讨厌别人不把我当回事。 /// Uh, we have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. Try not to forget about it. Being forgotten sucks.
Conversation/acObj/Line01656=我没说你们必须要去，但是如果你们想要解救我说的那只拜舍尔鲸鸟的话，那就抓紧时间。 /// So, I'm not saying you have to, but if you want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, you don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01657=一旦拜舍尔鲸鸟的地嗪被抽干，它就会死的。所以，要献爱心就赶快。如果你们有的话。 /// Once the Bel'shir glider's terrazine is gone, it'll be dead. So try to free it sooner than later. If you have a heart, that is.
Conversation/acObj/Line01658=（这看起来不太对，如果这样算的话，那就是，对）我粗算了一下，拜舍尔鲸鸟很快就要死了。留给你们救它的时间已经不多了。 /// (Mumbles calculations to himself)By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. You don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01659=拜舍尔鲸鸟在这颗星球上存在时间并不长，指挥官们。如果你们不拯救它，以后会后悔的。 /// The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world, commanders. You'll miss your chance if you don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01660=呃，我不知道你们有没有考虑过要救拜舍尔鲸鸟，但现在基本已经没有机会了。 /// Well, you're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death, commanders. If you were ever planning on it, anyway.
Conversation/acObj/Line01661=拜舍尔鲸鸟马上就要死了，指挥官们。再看它最后一眼吧，以后可就真的看不到了。 /// The Bel'shir glider is almost dead, commanders. It's now or never. Literally. You could choose either one.
Conversation/acObj/Line01662=噢，你们居然就这么让那东西死掉了。我算是看清你们了。 /// Wow, you really just let that thing die. And I thought I knew you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01663=好吧，那是一只死掉的鲸鸟。它之前可能已经濒临灭绝了，你们知道的。 /// Well, that's one dead whale. It was probably endangered, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01664=他们把那只生物给彻底吸干了！拜舍尔肯定会很生气的…… /// They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this...
Conversation/acObj/Line01665=那只生物的所有地嗪都被抽干了。连命都没了！呃啊啊！真是一场悲剧……就像我的人生一样。 /// All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! Tsk tsk. What a tragedy... just like my career.
Conversation/acObj/Line01666=你们救了它！拜舍尔感谢你们，指挥官们。我是说……我感谢你们。是的。我很感谢。 /// You saved it! Bel'shir thanks you, commanders. I mean... I thank you. Yes. Me. With the thanking.
Conversation/acObj/Line01667=不敢相信他们一直在从那些动物身上提取地嗪。我为什么就没想到这点呢！？ /// I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line01668=嘿，呃，你们有没有碰巧存下提取的地嗪吗？没有？好吧……呃，没关系…… /// Hey um, did you happen to save any of the extracted terrazine? No? Okay... well, that's okay...
Conversation/acObj/Line01669=说真的，我之前还从未发现这周围还漂浮着那些东西。真不知道它们是从哪儿来的。 /// You know, I never noticed those things floating around here before. I wonder where they came from.
Conversation/acObj/Line01670=你们能来帮我们真是太好了，指挥官们。这颗星球爬满了感染体，我必须把我的人都救出去。 /// Glad you're with us, Commanders. This planet is crawling with infested, and I need to get my people out of here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01671=只要一启动飞船引擎那些怪物就会来袭击我们。如果在发射飞船的过程中得不到你们的保护，我们是绝对不可能活着离开这颗星球的。 /// Those things attack us whenever we spin up our engines. If you don't protect us while we launch, we'll never get off this rock.

Conversation/acObj/Line01673=我们的飞船只要一启动发射程序就会引来感染体。希望你们能在我们起飞的过程中提供保护。 /// Our ships can't start their launch sequences without attracting the infested. We need you to protect us until we're up in the air.
Conversation/acObj/Line01674=这里的情况急转直下，指挥官们。此次采矿行动结束了，我们需要立即离开此地。 /// Everything's gone straight to hell, Commanders. This mining operation is over, and we need to leave right now.
Conversation/acObj/Line01675=但是没有你们的保护，恐怕我们还没来得及起飞就会被感染体撕成碎片。 /// But without your protection, the infested will tear us apart before we can even take off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01676=我会把我们的飞船坐标发给你们。如果你们能在任何一艘飞船周围建立起一道防线，飞船的驾驶员就会启动发射程序了。 /// I'll send you the coordinates of our ships. If you set up a perimeter at one of them, its pilot will start the launch sequence.
Conversation/acObj/Line01677=这是我们各艘飞船的位置。每艘飞船只会在你们进入保护范围之内后才会发动引擎。 /// Here are the locations of our ships. Each one of them will fire up its engines when you're in range to protect it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01678=我们已经有多艘飞船准备发射了。准备好了就早点赶过去吧，这样他们就可以准备起飞了。 /// We have several ships ready for launch. Head out to one of them when you're ready so that it can prepare for lift off.
Conversation/acObj/Line01679=保持警戒。你们一定要牵制住感染体。 /// Keep your guard up. You'll have to keep the infested at bay.
Conversation/acObj/Line01680=要不了多久，引擎噪音就会把感染体吸引到你那里去了。 /// It won't be long before the noise draws the infested to your location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01681=现在听好了，你们必须挡住感染体，直到飞船升空为止。 /// Now listen, you need to hold off the infested until the ship's in the sky.
Conversation/acObj/Line01682=引擎正在启动。准备防守感染体。 /// Engines are starting up. Get ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01683=正在启动发射程序。这肯定会引起感染体注意的。 /// Starting the launch sequence. That's sure to get the infested's attention.
Conversation/acObj/Line01684=全都指望你们了，指挥官们。发射进行中。 /// We're counting on you, commanders. Launch in progress.

Conversation/acObj/Line01859=终于等到援军了！听着，我们需要赶在整个星球都被感染之前，将病原体全部清理干净。 /// Finally, some back up! Look, I need to get rid of this infestation before it spreads to the rest of the planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01860=感染体一到夜里就会出动，但是它们不敢见阳光。所以抓住白天的机会，清理掉它们的建筑。 /// The infested come out at night, but they can't survive the daylight. Use that time to take out their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01861=这颗星球遇到大麻烦了。如果任由这股感染扩散，所有人恐怕都活不了。我们必须阻止这一切。 /// This planet is in serious trouble. If this infestation spreads, there won't be any survivors. We need to stop it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01862=晚上行动会非常危险，好在感染体一到白天就不敢出来。等太阳出来了，我们就出去烧掉它们的建筑。 /// It's risky to move at night, but the infested die off during the day. When the sun is up, move out and burn their structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01863=注意，指挥官们。天马上就要黑了，感染体很快就要冲我们来了。 /// Heads up, commanders. The day's almost over, which means the infested are gonna come for us soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01864=我们快见不到阳光了。一旦太阳下山，感染体很快就会来冲击我们的营地。 /// We're almost out of daylight. Once the sun sets, the infested will come knocking on our door.
Conversation/acObj/Line01865=夜晚即将来临。如果我是你的话，我会立即开始准备对付感染体。 /// Night's almost here. I'd start getting ready to deal with the infested if I were you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01866=看样子太阳快要落山了。准备迎接夜幕。 /// Looks like the sun's about to set. Get ready for nightfall.
Conversation/acObj/Line01867=别跑太远。白天时间已经所剩无几了。 /// Don't go out too far. There isn't much time left in the day.
Conversation/acObj/Line01868=天快黑了，指挥官们。 /// The day's going to end soon, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01869=又一个白天即将过去。 /// Another day's coming to an end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01870=抓紧白天的时间，指挥官们。天马上就要黑了。 /// Make the most of the day, commanders. It's nearly over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01871=夜晚马上来临。准备对付感染体。 /// It's almost nighttime. Be ready for the infested.
Conversation/acObj/Line01872=快没时间了。别忘了我们的基地在晚上需要保护。 /// Time is running out. Don't forget that our base will need to be defended at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01873=到晚上了，指挥官们！防守感染体，坚持到天明！ /// It's nighttime, commanders! Fight off the infested until daybreak!
Conversation/acObj/Line01874=最后一缕阳光消散了。我们的防御必须坚守到第二天天明！ /// That's the last of the sunlight. Our defenses have to hold until the night is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01875=太阳已经落下！准备防御感染体，坚持到第二天的太阳升起！ /// The sun is down! Defend against the infested until it rises again!
Conversation/acObj/Line01876=我们要经受一个可怕的夜晚了，不过我相信我们能存活下来。 /// We're in for a rough night, but I know we can survive it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01877=打起精神，指挥官们。漫漫长夜才刚刚开始。 /// Sit tight, commanders. This night's just getting started. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01878=又一个夜晚，又一场苦战。一定要把它们挡在我们的基地之外！ /// Another night, another fight. Keep them out of our base!
Conversation/acObj/Line01879=外面死了好多的人。我们可不想加入他们。 /// A lot of dead out there. Make sure that we don't join them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01880=我之前听说感染很可怕，但是这也太吓人了！一定要挡住它们！ /// I knew the infestation was bad, but this is crazy! Hold them off!
Conversation/acObj/Line01881=继续战斗，指挥官们。我们一定能活过今晚的。 /// Just keep fighting, commanders. We'll make it through the night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01882=感染体来了。我们必须挡住它们，坚持到太阳再度升起。 /// Here come the infested. We have to hold them off until sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01883=太阳现在随时都有可能升起。然后，感染体就会全部燃烧殆尽。 /// The sun will rise any minute now. Then the infested will burn away.
Conversation/acObj/Line01884=再坚持小会儿，指挥官们。感染体是无法在阳光下存活的。 /// Just a little longer, commanders. The infested can't survive in the sun.
Conversation/acObj/Line01885=夜晚就快要过完了。等太阳出来，我们又可以安全地出去了。 /// The night's almost over. We'll be safe to move out again in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01886=我们能做到的，指挥官们。天马上就要亮了。 /// We can do this, commanders. It's almost sunrise.
Conversation/acObj/Line01887=坚持住！黑夜即将过去！ /// Keep it up! Night's coming to an end soon!
Conversation/acObj/Line01888=感染体如此疯狂地攻击我们。再过一会儿，就该轮到我们让它们尝尝厉害了。 /// The infested can attack us all they want. Soon, it's gonna be our turn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01889=形势虽然危急，但是持续不了多久了。黎明即将到来。 /// This may look bad, but it won't last much longer. Morning's almost here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01890=黎明近在眼前。一定要坚守住防线！ /// Daybreak is just around the corner. Hold the line until then!
Conversation/acObj/Line01891=不要放弃，指挥官们。这场噩梦即将结束。 /// Don't give up, commanders. This nightmare is about to end.
Conversation/acObj/Line01892=这就是黎明前的黑暗，一定要挺过这一关。 /// It won't be long now. We just have to survive until dawn.
Conversation/acObj/Line01893=你们确定要在晚上这么做，各位指挥官？感染体随时都有可能扑向这里！ /// You sure you want to do that at night, commanders? The infested will be here any minute!
Conversation/acObj/Line01894=强攻不是不可以，但是我不建议这么做，指挥官们。白天打建筑反而可以事半功倍。 /// I like the hustle, but I'd advise against it, commanders. It'll be easier to take out the structures in the daytime.
Conversation/acObj/Line01895=不要在外面浪了。如果我们的基地被感染体攻陷，整个星球就完了。 /// Don't get too bold out there. If our base falls to the infested, this planet will be lost.
Conversation/acObj/Line01896=正在发送更多的建筑坐标给你们。 /// Sending you the coordinates for more structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01897=我在我的扫描器上发现了另一个建筑区。 /// I've got another sector with structures on my scanners.
Conversation/acObj/Line01898=行动尚未结束，指挥官们。还有更多的建筑需要烧毁。 /// We're not done yet, commanders. Here are some more structures to burn out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01899=好像我们可以在这一区域找到更多建筑。 /// Looks like we can find additional structures here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01900=该位置探测到更多建筑。 /// Detecting more structures at this location.
Conversation/acObj/Line01901=呃。是埃蒙。倒霉。看来我们要先消灭他的部队，才能焚烧那些建筑。 /// Ugh. Amon. Great. Looks like we have to fight through his forces to get to the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01902=埃蒙的部队想让我们远离那些建筑。不能让他们得逞！ /// Amon's forces are trying to keep us away from the structures. Don't let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line01903=我发现有敌方部队朝那些建筑去了。 /// I'm picking up hostile forces headed for the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01904=所以我们要同时对付埃蒙的部队和感染体了？真是祸不单行…… /// So we have to fight Amon's forces AND the infested? This just keeps getting better...
Conversation/acObj/Line01905=不敢相信埃蒙的部队竟然想要保护那些建筑。把他们解决掉！ /// I can't believe Amon's forces are trying to protect those structures. Take them out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01906=小心那些猎杀体。它们不仅速度快，而且还能跳。 /// Look out for those hunterlings. They're fast, and boy can they JUMP.
Conversation/acObj/Line01907=猎杀体来了！它们可是会翻越悬崖的，一定要注意。 /// Incoming hunterlings! They're cliff jumpers, so watch out.
Conversation/acObj/Line01908=是猎杀体！那些东西跑得很快，而且还能翻越悬崖！ /// Hunterlings! Those things move fast, and they can jump up cliffs!
Conversation/acObj/Line01909=我们把这些异形叫做“炸弹怪”。它们不仅会吐酸液，死的时候还会爆炸。 /// We call these ones "kaboomers." They spit acid, and they explode when they die.
Conversation/acObj/Line01910=远离那些炸弹怪。它们叫这个名字可是有原因的。 /// Keep your distance from those kaboomers. We call them that for a reason, you know.
Conversation/acObj/Line01911=陆战队员把这些异形称之为“炸弹怪”。它们会吐酸液就已经够难对付的了，结果死的时候还会爆炸。 /// The marines named these ones "kaboomers." The acid spit is bad enough, but just wait until they explode.
Conversation/acObj/Line01912=是扼喉怪。如果对其放任不管，它们会拖拽并毒晕你的部队。 /// Chokers. They'll pull in your forces and stun them if they aren't dealt with.
Conversation/acObj/Line01913=那些扼喉怪真是个坏消息。它们会把猎物拖过去，然后用毒素将其毒晕。 /// Those chokers are bad news. They'll pull in their prey and stun them with their toxins.
Conversation/acObj/Line01914=小心那些扼喉怪。它们会把你的部队拖过去，毒晕，然后再杀死猎物。 /// Beware of those chokers. They'll stun and kill your forces after pulling them in.
Conversation/acObj/Line01915=空中发现监控体。在它们造成问题之前将其打掉。 /// Spotters are in the air. Shoot them down before they become a problem.
Conversation/acObj/Line01916=侦测到一些监控体。它们会飞，所以你最好留意一下。 /// Detecting some spotters. They can fly, so you better keep an eye on them.
Conversation/acObj/Line01917=空中有不少感染体的监控体。你最好尽快处理一下它们。 /// The infested have spotters in the sky. You should probably deal with them soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line01918=腐尸怪！？那种东西不怕阳光！我们一定要解决它。 /// A stank!? Those things are resistant to sunlight! We have to be the ones to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01919=那个腐尸怪很强大，它连阳光都不怕。我们必须亲自动手把它消灭掉。 /// That stank is strong enough to withstand sunlight. We have to kill it ourselves.
Conversation/acObj/Line01920=哦不，不要来腐尸怪！如果我们不解决它，就算天亮了它也不会消失！ /// Oh no, not a stank! If we don't kill it, it'll keep attacking us even after sunrise!
Conversation/acObj/Line01921=我们的一处屏障正在遭受攻击。 /// One of our barricades is being hit hard.
Conversation/acObj/Line01922=感染体正试图突破我们的一处屏障。 /// The infested are trying to break through one of our barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01923=一处屏障正在遭受攻击！ /// A barricade is under attack!
Conversation/acObj/Line01924=我们有一处屏障正在遭受大量伤害。 /// We've got a barricade taking some damage here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01925=我看见一处屏障外面涌满了感染体。 /// I'm seeing the infested gather at one of the barricades.
Conversation/acObj/Line01926=看样子它们正试图拆毁一处屏障。 /// Looks like they're trying to tear down a barricade.
Conversation/acObj/Line01927=如果不想失去那处屏障的话，你们就得对其进行防守。 /// You'll have to defend that barricade if it's going to stay standing.
Conversation/acObj/Line01928=各位指挥官，那处屏障坚持不了多久了。 /// Commanders, that barricade won't hold up for much longer.
Conversation/acObj/Line01929=呃，我们恐怕马上就要在那处屏障那里遇到麻烦了。 /// Uh, we might have a problem with that barricade pretty soon here.
Conversation/acObj/Line01930=我们的一处屏障即将被摧毁。 /// One of our barricades is nearly destroyed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01931=感染体马上就要攻破那处屏障了！ /// The infested are about to take down that barricade!
Conversation/acObj/Line01932=快击退那处屏障外面的感染体，否则屏障会被摧毁的！ /// Keep the infested off that barricade, or it's going to fall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01933=我们损失了一处屏障！快派一些防御部队，否则感染体会直接冲进来的！ /// We've lost a barricade! Get some defenses in place or the infested will walk right in!
Conversation/acObj/Line01934=一处屏障没了……我们需要在晚上布置更多的防守兵力了。 /// There goes a barricade... We're going to need more defenses at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01935=指挥官！感染体已经突破了一处屏障！快阻止它们！ /// Commanders! The infested have broken through a barricade! We have to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line01936=一处屏障被摧毁了！如果不派出更多的防守兵力，我们的基地将会爬满感染体！ /// A barricade's been destroyed! Without additional defenses, our base will be crawling with infested!
Conversation/acObj/Line01937=感染体推倒了一处屏障。我们必须布置更多的防御力量，否则麻烦就大了！ /// The infested have brought down a barricade. We have to put up more defenses or we're in big trouble!
Conversation/acObj/Line01938=好的，各位指挥官。我们今天需要摧毁足够多的建筑，才能减少感染体的威胁。我已经给你标好了几处坐标。 /// Okay, commanders. We need to destroy enough structures today to stay ahead of the infestation. I've already marked a few for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line01939=我们终于见到阳光了。要想阻止这场感染，就必须每天摧毁一定数量的建筑才行。前往这些坐标开始吧。 /// We made it to the dawn. To stop the infestation, we need to destroy enough of it each day. Head to these coordinates to start.
Conversation/acObj/Line01940=该干活了。我们必须赶在天黑之前烧掉足够多的感染物。先从我标记的建筑开始吧。 /// Time to get to work. We have to burn away enough of the infestation before the day ends. Start with the structures I've marked.
Conversation/acObj/Line01941=看来我们又熬过了一晚。我更新了今天需要摧毁的建筑数量，方便你们跟踪。 /// Looks like we survived another night. I've updated the number of structures we need to destroy today to stay on track.
Conversation/acObj/Line01942=我们开始干活吧，指挥官们。今天必须要烧掉足够数量的感染物，这样我们才不会进度落后。 /// Let's get to work, commanders. We have to burn enough of the infestation today so that we don't fall behind.
Conversation/acObj/Line01943=天亮了，我们也该出发了。如果今天烧掉的建筑太少的话，我们后面恐怕会时间不够。 /// Sunrise, that's our cue to move. We won't have enough time later if we destroy too few structures today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01944=早上好，指挥官们。我们只剩两天的时间了，白天的时候可千万别偷懒啊。 /// Good morning, commanders. We've got two days left, and our work is definitely cut out for us.
Conversation/acObj/Line01945=我们还有两天的时间来阻止这场感染。一定要珍惜时间啊。 /// We have two more days to stop the infestation. Let's make them count.
Conversation/acObj/Line01946=帅哥，这颗星球昼夜交替得很快。我们只有两天的时间来清理这股感染了。 /// Boy, the days go by fast on this planet. We have two more to burn away the infestation.
Conversation/acObj/Line01947=加油喔，各位指挥官！今天一定要把感染物都清理干净，否则这颗星球就完了！ /// Let's do this, commanders! Finish off the infestation today, or this planet is toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line01948=我们好不容易走到这一步，现在是时候结束它了。在天黑之前，处理掉最后一处感染。 /// We've come this far, and now it's time to end it. Take out the last of the infestation before the day is over.
Conversation/acObj/Line01949=就是现在，指挥官们！整个星球的民众都在指望着我们。烧毁剩余的所有感染物。 /// It's now or never, commanders. The people on this planet are counting on us. Burn all the infestation that's left.
Conversation/acObj/Line01950=我们进展不错，不过仍然有不少的感染物要清理。 /// We're making good progress, but there's still a lot of infestation to go.
Conversation/acObj/Line01951=我们好像已经清理了不少感染物。但是要保持这个势头。 /// It looks like we've taken out a good amount of infestation. Just need to keep it up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01952=剩下的感染物仍然有不少，不过每一处我们都会清干净的。 /// There's still a lot of infestation left, but we'll get every last bit of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01953=我们已经完成一半了，指挥官们。继续努力，我们一定能拯救这颗星球。 /// We're halfway there, commanders. Keep it up and we can still save this planet.
Conversation/acObj/Line01954=大约有一半的感染物都被清理掉了。不要松懈。 /// About half of the infestation has been cleared out. Don't give up.
Conversation/acObj/Line01955=我的扫描显示大约有一半的感染物都被清理干净了。我们一定能成功的。 /// My scans show that half of the infestation is gone. We can do this.
Conversation/acObj/Line01956=绝大部分感染物都被处理了。只剩一点点了！ /// Most of the infestation has been dealt with. Just a little more to go!
Conversation/acObj/Line01957=绝大部分感染物都没了。但我们必须清理干净残余的建筑才算是完成任务。 /// The infestation is almost gone. But we need to get the rest of it for this to work.
Conversation/acObj/Line01958=绝大部分感染物都被我们烧掉了。我们来处理完最后一部分吧。 /// We've burned out almost all of the infestation. Let's finish the job.
Conversation/acObj/Line01959=我在战场上发现了一只噬毒体。杀掉它可以防止感染进一步扩散，但是我们只能在晚上才能那么做。 /// I'm detecting a virophage in the field. Killing it could prevent future infestations, but we'll have to attack it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01960=感染体当中好像出现了一只噬毒体。杀掉它确实是个不错的主意，但是我们只能在晚上进行。 /// Looks like there's a virophage among the infested. Might be a good idea to kill it, but we can only do that at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01961=外面有一只噬毒体，指挥官们。如果可以的话请杀掉它，不过你们要到晚上才能那么做。 /// There's a virophage out there, commanders. Kill it if you can, but you'll have to do it at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01962=天亮之前，噬毒体都是可以被攻击的。如果现在不方便杀掉它的话，那你们明晚再去吧。 /// You have until sunrise to attack the virophage. If you can't kill it now, you can come back to it tomorrow night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01963=太阳一出来，噬毒体就会潜地。所以要杀掉它的话，一个晚上的时间恐怕不够。 /// That virophage will burrow once the sun is up. It may take you more than one night to kill it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01964=如果今天晚上没机会杀掉噬毒体，你们也别担心。我确定它明天还会回来的。 /// Don't worry if you can't kill the virophage tonight. I'm sure it'll be back tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01965=干得漂亮，指挥官们。这下我们清理掉建筑之后就不用担心噬毒体了。 /// Nice job, commanders. Now we don't have to worry about the virophage after we clear out the structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01966=你们刚才帮我解决了一个大麻烦，指挥官们。我原本打算等任务结束之后再动手呢。 /// You just saved me a lot of trouble, commanders. I was going to send a crew to exterminate that thing after this mission.
Conversation/acObj/Line01967=这下这颗星球要操心的麻烦事又少了一件。谢谢各位指挥官。 /// Well, that's one less headache to worry about on this planet. Thanks, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01968=该死，它们的数量太多了！我们现在只能尽可能多地把人撤离这颗星球了。 /// Damn, there's just too much of it! We have to get as many people off this planet as we can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01969=这下没有什么能阻止感染体了，指挥官们。这颗星球没救了，无数人也将难逃此劫。 /// There's no stopping the infestation now. This planet's gone, commanders. And a lot of people with it.
Conversation/acObj/Line01970=那是最后一处！星球得救了，指挥官们！我替所有人谢谢你们。 /// That's the last of it! The planet's saved, commanders! And we have you to thank.
Conversation/acObj/Line01971=我不敢相信！我们真的成功了！我是说，我当然能成功。我对此从未有过半点怀疑。 /// I can't believe it! We actually did it! I mean, of course we did it. Never had a doubt.
Conversation/acObj/Line01972=自从加入UED到现在，我还从未有过如此险象环生的经历。感谢你们拯救了我们所有人，指挥官们。 /// Haven't seen a situation that hairy since I was in the UED. Thanks for getting us through it, commanders.
Conversation/acObj/Line01973=什么，那些特殊的感染体都能隐形了？太棒了，真是怕什么来什么。 /// What, now those special infested are cloaked? Great, just what we needed.
Conversation/acObj/Line01974=保持警惕！其中一些特殊的感染体会隐形。 /// Stay alert! Some of those special infested can cloak.
Conversation/acObj/Line01975=好像那些特殊的感染体会隐形。但愿你们已经有所准备了。 /// Looks like the special infested can cloak. Hope you're ready for this. 
Conversation/acObj/Line01976=干得漂亮，各位指挥官！我们今天烧得越多，明天就越轻松！ /// Nice work, commanders! The more we torch today, the fewer we have to deal with tomorrow!
Conversation/acObj/Line01977=向你们求救还真是求对人了。按照这个速度，我们明天要处理的建筑将会少得多。 /// I see you were the right ones to call. At this rate, we'll have fewer structures to destroy tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01978=我们今天烧掉了足够多的建筑，所以明天相对会轻松一点。不过也只是一点啦。 /// We've burned enough structures today, so tomorrow should be a little easier on us. Just a little.
Conversation/acObj/Line01979=我非常开心能遇到你们这样做事高效的人。明天要处理的将会轻松得多。 /// Glad to be teamed up with fellow overachievers. We'll be less crunched for time tomorrow.
Conversation/acObj/Line01980=我必须给你们一个大大的赞。照你们今天这个进度，我得调整一下明天的预估任务量了。 /// I have to say, I'm impressed. I'll revise the estimate for tomorrow based on what you've done today.
Conversation/acObj/Line01981=时间所剩无几。如果白天不多摧毁一些建筑，晚上感染体就会多到无法控制！ /// There's not much time left. Destroy enough of the structures today, or the infestation will grow out of control!
Conversation/acObj/Line01982=太阳即将落下！快烧掉那些建筑，否则一切都完了！ /// The sun's about to set! Torch those structures before it's too late!
Conversation/acObj/Line01983=我们必须加快速度！留给我们的时间不多了！ /// We have to pick up the pace! Time is running out!
Conversation/acObj/Line01984=如果我们不赶在日落之前多烧掉一些建筑，整个星球都将沦丧！ /// If we don't destroy more structures before sundown, this whole planet will be lost!
Conversation/acObj/Line01985=加油，指挥官们。留给我们摧毁那些建筑的时间不多了。 /// Come on, commanders. We don't have much more time to destroy those structures.
Conversation/acObj/Line01986=现在必须分秒必争。一定要赶在夜晚到来之前烧掉那些建筑！ /// Cutting it real close, here. Those structures need to burn before nightfall!
Conversation/acObj/Line01987=白天马上就要过完了，然而需要烧掉的建筑还有很多！ /// We're running out of daylight, and there are still more structures to burn!
Conversation/acObj/Line01988=太棒了！这股感染很快就可以烧干净了！ /// Way to go! This infestation will be burned away in no time!
Conversation/acObj/Line01989=吁！这下今天要处理的已经够了。不过如果你还想多烧一些的话，请随意。 /// Whew! That's at least enough for today. But feel free to take out more of them if you can.
Conversation/acObj/Line01990=啊，埃蒙准备派他的部队支援感染体。这将会是无比漫长的一夜。 /// Ugh, Amon's supporting the infested with his own forces. It's gonna be a long night.
Conversation/acObj/Line01991=不会吧？埃蒙也想趁现在攻击我们？算他狠。 /// Are you kidding me? Amon wants to attack us now, too? Perfect.
Conversation/acObj/Line01992=看来埃蒙想要对我们趁火打劫啊。快让防御部队准备就位！ /// Looks like Amon wants a piece of us, too. Get those defenses in place!
Conversation/acObj/Line01993=噬毒体对空中单位非常危险。一定要谨慎。 /// Virophages are especially dangerous to air units. Proceed with caution.
Conversation/acObj/Line01994=当心了，噬毒体能轻而易举地打掉你的空中单位。 /// Watch out, that virophage can make quick work of your air units.
Conversation/acObj/Line01995=别让那只噬毒体打掉你们过多的空中单位，指挥官们。 /// Don't let that virophage take out too many of your air units, commanders.

Conversation/acObj/Line02359=听着，其它这些机器人确实不像盖瑞一样完美，但这并不意味着我不爱它们。如果你能保护好它们的安全，我会非常感激的。 /// Look, just because these other bots aren't as perfect as Gary doesn't mean I don't love them. I'd appreciate it if you help me keep them safe.
Conversation/acObj/Line02360=我想这些机器人是在跟我说它们准备变形出击，不过我也可能猜错。我上次在这里的时候它们就骗过我，那些小坏蛋！ /// I think the bots are telling us they're rolling out, but I could be wrong. They lied to me the last time I was here, those little miscreants!
Conversation/acObj/Line02361=机器人出发了！这些小家伙比我上一次吆喝的时候长大了不少！爸爸爱死你们啦！ /// There go the bots! (Sniffs) They've grown up so much since the last time I saw them! Daddy loves you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02362=快看，机器人出发了！要是我把它们升级成超级采集器的话，它们会更厉害……但是盖瑞肯定会妒忌的。 /// Look at the bots go! They'd be even better if I upgraded them into Super Harvesters... (sigh, frustrated) but Gary will get jealous if I do that. 
Conversation/acObj/Line02363=我的机器人正在采集地嗪。注意！我们必须保护好它的安全，直到它采完。 /// My bot is collecting the terrazine now. Pay attention! We have to defend it until it's done.
Conversation/acObj/Line02364=好吧，现在开始采集地嗪。盖瑞，别让机器人把工作搞砸了，否则我拿你试问！ /// Alright, collecting the terrazine now. Gary, make sure the bot does its job or I will hold you accountable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02365=他们在追我的机器人！我们必须阻止他们！ /// They're coming after my bots! We need to stop them!
Conversation/acObj/Line02366=啊，坏蛋来了！不过这次我有不少新朋友可以跟他们说“哈喽”。 /// Gah, here come the bad guys! At least this time I have some new friends to say "Hello."
Conversation/acObj/Line02367=噢！我探测到有敌人朝机器人过去了！ /// Uh oh! I'm detecting enemy movement toward the bots!
Conversation/acObj/Line02368=敌人明显是想攻击我的机器人。我们不能让他们那么做！ /// The enemy clearly intends to attack my bots. We CANNOT let them do that!
Conversation/acObj/Line02369=噢，太棒了！敌人冲我的机器人过去了。我就说我该让盖瑞给机器人再多装些炮塔的。 /// Oh, that's just great! The enemy is moving toward my bots. I knew I should have told Gary to put more turrets on those things!
Conversation/acObj/Line02370=抱歉，坏蛋们，拜舍尔今天关门了！你们最好收拾包裹赶紧滚蛋。 /// Sorry, bad guys, Bel'shir is closed today! You better pack it up and get outta here.
Conversation/acObj/Line02371=采集机器人开始返程了。我们要继续保护好它的安全，直到它回来。 /// The harvesting bot is returning now. We'll have to continue guarding it until it arrives.
Conversation/acObj/Line02372=机器人准备回来了。它肯定被吓坏了，我们一定要保护好它。 /// The bot is heading back. It's scared, so we should keep it company.
Conversation/acObj/Line02373=一次成功的地嗪采集！现在那个机器人要做的就是平安返回。给它一点鼓励，盖瑞！ /// A successful terrazine harvest! Now that bot just has to make it home safely. Give it some emotional support, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02374=快回家吧，小机器人！我和我的朋友们会保护你的！ /// Come on home, little bots! Me and my friends will protect you!
Conversation/acObj/Line02375=好了，机器人应该要回家了。我的地嗪存量很低，我需要新的补给……用于我的……实验。 /// Okay, the bots should be on their way back. I'm low on terrazine and I need a new supply... for my... experiments.
Conversation/acObj/Line02376=机器人正在向我回撤。还是我的这些机器人办事靠谱啊。不像某个机器小伙伴，我就不点它的名字了。(咳嗽)盖瑞。(咳嗽) /// The bots are returning now. I can always count on them to do that. Unlike a CERTAIN robot companion, whom I will not name. (cough) Gary. (cough)
Conversation/acObj/Line02377=地嗪罐装满了！我的机器人即将开始返程。大家都盯紧了，决不能让它们有任何意外！ /// Terrazine tank is full! My bots are making the return trip now. Let's stay close so we can keep them safe!
Conversation/acObj/Line02378=竞速赛开始了！哪个机器人能第一个回到我这儿来呢？别嫉妒，盖瑞。这只是一场游戏，我还是会给你用最好的机油的。 /// And the race is on! Which bot will make it back to me first? (beat) Don't get jealous, Gary. It's just a game. I still keep the best oil for you.
Conversation/acObj/Line02379=我的机器人正在向基地回撤。我们要小心喔，外面可是一大片丛林！喔……真的是哎。 /// My bots are heading back to base. We have to be careful. It's a jungle out there! Oh... it is.
Conversation/acObj/Line02380=嘿！嘿，它们在袭击我的机器人！我们得做点什么！ /// Hey! Hey, they're attacking my bots! We need to do something! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02381=早上好，朋友们！敌人正在拿我的机器人做早餐！除非你想成为下一个，否则我们得做点什么！ /// Good morning, friends! The enemy's eating my bots for breakfast! Unless YOU want to be next, we need to do something!
Conversation/acObj/Line02382=敌人在攻击我的机器人！你为什么不早点提醒我们呢，盖瑞？ /// The enemy's attacking my bots! Why didn't you warn us about this, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02383=敌人朝我的机器人涌过去了！我这就派我的机械虫群过去！ /// Enemy forces have converged on my bots! I'll get my mecha-swarm in there!
Conversation/acObj/Line02384=那些混蛋正在把我的机器人砸个稀巴烂！我真的不想像上次一样，跟在它们后面捡零件啊！ /// Those guys are smashing my bots to pieces! And I really don't wanna pick up after them like the last time I was here!
Conversation/acObj/Line02385=我的机器人被打了！喔不，这次绝不是幻像。 /// My bots are under attack! And no, I am NOT hallucinating this time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02386=呃是的……我很好，我没事……只是我的机器人正被敌人砸得稀巴烂！ /// So, uh... everything's fine here... except for the fact that the enemy is smashing my bots to pieces!
Conversation/acObj/Line02387=快看呐，盖瑞，你的兄弟姐妹们回来了！而且还装满了地嗪！ /// Look, Gary, your brothers and sisters are back! And they have terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02388=好消息，盖瑞！我们的机器人成功带回了地嗪！嗯，这对我来说真是好消息。 /// Good news, Gary! Our bots have brought us terrazine! Well, it's good news for me.
Conversation/acObj/Line02389=机器人回来了！即使这次已经经过那么久了，它们还是能把工作完成！ /// The bots have returned! Even after all this time, they can still get the job done! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02390=呼！我的机器人回来了！这次好像我又赌赢了，拜舍尔！ /// Whew! My bots have returned! Looks like I won the bet AGAIN, Bel'shir!
Conversation/acObj/Line02391=嘿，朋友们，你们听到了吗？没错，我的宝贝机器人烧着了！再损失的话，我们都得玩完！ /// Hey, friends, you hear that? Yeah, it's just my precious bot going up in flames! One more, and we're toast!
Conversation/acObj/Line02392=噢，拜托！我不能再承受损失任何机器人了！否则我只能去求盖瑞了，但是它会跟我就工作职责争个没完的…… /// Oh, come on! I can't afford to lose any more bots! Then I'll have to ask Gary to harvest the terrazine, and we'll get into this big argument about job responsibilities...
Conversation/acObj/Line02393=我们开局不错，拿到一罐地嗪！但是要补全我已经用掉的还要采不少呢。 /// We've got the start of a good terrazine cache! But it's gonna take a lot more to replace what I've already used.
Conversation/acObj/Line02394=嗯，看样子我们进展得不错。但是需要采集更多的地嗪才能继续我的……呃……研究，没错！ /// Hmm, looks like we're making progress. It's gonna take more terrazine than that to continue my... uh... research, that's right!
Conversation/acObj/Line02395=你问需要这么多地嗪做什么？当然是搞科学研究啦！ /// What does anyone need this much terrazine for, you ask? Science, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line02396=我的地嗪罐差不多满一半了。拜舍尔今天真是大方！我猜她是真的想我了…… /// My terrazine tanks are about halfway full. Bel'shir's being really generous today! I guess she missed me...
Conversation/acObj/Line02397=噢，快看这满满的地嗪！全都是我的——呃，我是说，是我们的。 /// Ooh, look at all that terrazine! And it's all mine! Ours... I mean it's all ours.
Conversation/acObj/Line02398=我们几乎已经采满了我需要的所有地嗪……呃我是说，我们需要的！因为，毕竟我会分你一部分(紧张的笑)。呃……加油干吧，朋友们！ /// We've got almost all the terrazine I need... I mean, we need! Because, of course, I'll share some. (nervous laughter) Uh... let's keep it up, friends!
Conversation/acObj/Line02399=我的地嗪罐到底有一半是空的呢，还是有一半是满的呢？嗨，把它们全都装满这个就不是问题了！ /// Are my terrazine tanks are half empty, or half full? Huh. This wouldn't be a problem if they were completely full!
Conversation/acObj/Line02400=不是吧？他们正在从拜舍尔的动物身上提取地嗪！盖瑞，你怎么看？我们要救它吗？ /// Oh, what? They're siphoning the terrazine from Bel'shir's fauna! Gary, what do you think? Should we free it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02401=敌人正在从拜舍尔鲸鸟身上提取地嗪！这可是一个考验你同情心的好机会啊，盖瑞。你打算怎么办？ /// The enemy is draining the terrazine from the Bel'shir gliders! This is a great chance to test your empathy, Gary. What would you do? 
Conversation/acObj/Line02402=他们正在直接从巨型拜舍尔鲸鸟身上提取地嗪！如果我们能救它的话，拜舍尔会对我们很满意的。 /// They're taking terrazine directly out of the majestic gliders! If we save it, Bel'shir will be very happy with us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02403=看样子他们又困住了另一只拜舍尔鲸鸟。这次要怎么做，盖瑞？ /// Looks like they've trapped another Bel'shir glider. What'll it be this time, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02404=不好了，他们正在加倍从活物身上提取地嗪。你觉得我们应该阻止一下？ /// Yeesh, they're really doubling down on this living terrazine extraction plan. You think we should put a stop to it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02405=又有一只拜舍尔鲸鸟在被抽取身上的地嗪。我听出来了……它在哭喊着向我求救。 /// Another Bel'shir glider is being drained of its terrazine. It's crying out to me for help... I think.
Conversation/acObj/Line02406=拜舍尔鲸鸟的地嗪可不是永远也吸不完的。如果我们想要救它的话，最好现在就做些什么！ /// The Bel'shir glider's terrazine won't last forever. If we're gonna save it, we have to do it now!
Conversation/acObj/Line02407=我们只有极为有限的时间可以去救拜舍尔鲸鸟。盖瑞，你对那只生物被死亡慢慢迫近的处境有什么感受? /// We have only a limited amount of time to save the Bel'shir glider's life. How does the creature's impending doom make you feel, Gary?
Conversation/acObj/Line02408=如果我们真的想救我说的那只拜舍尔鲸鸟的话，那就必须马上做点什么。 /// If we want to free that Bel'shir glider I mentioned, we don't have all day.
Conversation/acObj/Line02409=如果我们能救下那只鲸鸟，拜舍尔会很感激的。如果我们坐视不管，她就会——你懂的——她会用神力惩罚我们。 /// Bel'shir would appreciate it if we saved that glider. If we don't do something, she might, you know, punish us with her divine power.
Conversation/acObj/Line02410=（这看起来不太对，如果这样话，那么就，对）我粗算了一下，拜舍尔鲸鸟很快就要死了。留给我们救它的时间已经不多了。 /// (Mumbles calculations to himself) By my calculations, the Bel'shir glider is going to die soon. We don't have much time left to save it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02411=拜舍尔鲸鸟在这颗星球上存在时间并不长，指挥官们。如果我们不拯救它，以后会后悔的。 /// The Bel'shir glider's not long for this world. We'll miss our chance if we don't save it soon.
Conversation/acObj/Line02412=呃，我们几乎快没有时间来挽救拜舍尔鲸鸟了。难道我们就这样眼睁睁地看着它死去吗？ /// Well, we're almost out of time to prevent the Bel'shir glider's death. Are we just gonna ignore it?
Conversation/acObj/Line02413=拜舍尔鲸鸟马上就要死了。你准备怎么做，盖瑞？你的回答很可能会决定我以后还要不要信任你。 /// The Bel'shir glider is almost dead. What would you do, Gary? The answer you give will probably determine whether I ever trust you again.
Conversation/acObj/Line02414=真可怜，那只鲸鸟死了。盖瑞，你看上去一点也不在乎。我是不是要对你再做一次“底线测试”？ /// Well, the glider's dead. Gary, you don't look concerned about that AT ALL. Do I need to do another Baseline Test on you?
Conversation/acObj/Line02415=噢糟糕。我们就这样眼睁睁看着那只动物死掉了，不是吗？嗯……不过地嗪补给我们倒是弄到了不少。 /// Oops. We kind of just let that thing die, didn't we? Um... but at least the terrazine supplies are filling up.
Conversation/acObj/Line02416=好吧，那只鲸鸟死掉了。既然如此，我一会分析一下它的遗骸，做个机械版的出来。 /// Well, that's one dead whale. Ah well. I can analyze the remains later and make a mechanized version of it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02417=他们把那只生物给彻底吸干了！拜舍尔肯定会很生气的……她肯定会拿我们所有人撒气的。 /// They drained that creature completely dry! Bel'shir is going to be so mad about this... and she will direct her wrath at all of us.
Conversation/acObj/Line02418=那只生物身上的所有地嗪都被抽干了，连命都没了！噢，你在哭泣吗，盖瑞？你做得对。 /// All of that creature's terrazine is gone. And so is its life! (beat) Oh, NOW you're crying, Gary? A lot of good that does.
Conversation/acObj/Line02419=我们救了它！拜舍尔对我们的表现非常满意，朋友们。是的，也包括你，盖瑞。我跟她说是你的主意。 /// We saved it! Bel'shir is very happy with us, friends. Yes, even you, Gary. I told her that you thought it was a good idea.
Conversation/acObj/Line02420=感谢你支持我们拯救那只动物的决定，盖瑞。我之前还有点担心你可能是个冷血无情的混蛋呢。(紧张地笑) /// Thanks for supporting our choice to save that thing, Gary. I was getting a little worried you might be a cold, merciless psychopath. (nervous laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02421=我很高兴看到你对我们救下那只动物表现出开心，盖瑞。从今天开始，我不会在晚上睡觉的时候再防着你了。 /// I'm glad you're happy that we saved that thing, Gary. Now I don't have to restrain you when I sleep at night.
Conversation/acObj/Line02422=不！！！完全损失那批地嗪后，拜舍尔会要求献祭的！我静静地看着你，盖瑞！ /// Noooo! Bel'shir will demand a sacrificial offering after wasting all that terrazine. I'm looking at you, Gary!
Conversation/acObj/Line02423=漂亮，干得漂亮。所有的那批地嗪就这么……没了！(击打)什么？你居然怪到我头上，盖瑞？你真是不可理喻！ /// (Sarcastic) Nice job. Real nice. All that terrazine just... gone! (beat) What? You're blaming ME, Gary? You're unbelievable!
Conversation/acObj/Line02424=嘿！嘿！说话注意点，盖瑞。那不是我的错……至少这次不是。 /// Hey! Hey! Watch your mouth, Gary. That was NOT my fault... not this time, at least.
Conversation/acObj/Line02425=不，不，不！(叹气)为什么我这个每件事情都做不好的人，却又仍然如此优秀呢？ /// No, no, no! (sigh) How can I be so bad at everything I try, and still be so great?
Conversation/acObj/Line02426=喔伟大的拜舍尔。感谢你赐予这么美妙的地嗪礼物。(悄悄地对盖瑞说)盖瑞！别不懂规矩。快说“谢谢。” /// Oh great Bel'shir. Thank you for this wonderful gift of terrazine. (whispering to Gary) Gary! Don't be rude. Say "thank you."
Conversation/acObj/Line02427=我们成功了，朋友们！你们知道这意味着什么吗？(兴高采烈)没错——我不用再拆解盖瑞去做个新的好朋友啦！ /// We did it, friends! You know what that means? (very cheerful) That's right--I don't have to disassemble Gary and build a new best friend!
Conversation/acObj/Line02428=干得漂亮，盖瑞！你真的很适合干这一行啊。下次或许我会让你来控制我的机械虫群。 /// Great work, Gary! You're really getting the hang of this. Next time maybe I'll let you control my mecha-swarm.
Conversation/acObj/Line02429=你们表现得太棒了，各位！尤其是盖瑞。为此，我准备给他制作一个新朋友，我会叫她格蕾塔！ /// Excellent work, everyone! And didn't Gary do great? Just for that, I'm gonna build him a new friend. I'll call her Gretta! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02430=你听见了吗？地嗪正在地表之下流动。噢，更多的气泉就要出现了。 /// Do you hear that? It's the terrazine moving beneath the surface. Ooh, more geysers are on the way.
Conversation/acObj/Line02431=探测到地震活动！这只说明了一件事：马上就有更多的气泉了！ /// Seismic activity detected! That can only mean one thing: more geysers! 
Conversation/acObj/Line02432=如果谁敢跟我赌一把，我会把钱全押在马上要出现更多气泉上面。如果，我是说，如果我有钱的话。 /// If I were a betting man, I'd put money on more geysers showing up soon. If, you know, I had any money.
Conversation/acObj/Line02433=气泉即将回归，已经被万能的拜舍尔预言了！一起来见证吧！ /// The geysers are returning, as foretold by omniscient Bel'shir! Be ready!
Conversation/acObj/Line02434=这些是最后一批气泉！它们仅存的族类……全都孤零零地存在于太空深处…… /// These are the last of the geysers! The last of their kind... all alone in the depths of space...
Conversation/acObj/Line02435=这些应该就是最后一批气泉了！可惜我才刚刚觉得好玩呢。 /// These should be the last of the geysers! And things were just getting interesting.
Conversation/acObj/Line02436=嘿！机器人要跑了，我都还没给它们装上燃料电池呢！ /// Hey! The bots are leaving, and I didn't even get to pack them a refueling cell!
Conversation/acObj/Line02437=该是机器人回家的时间了。我讨厌它们整晚在外面鬼混，也不给我回个电话。 /// Time for the bots to come back. I hate it when they're out there all night without giving me a call.
Conversation/acObj/Line02438=地嗪采集程序已启动！整个过程要花上一些时间，所以提高警惕！ /// Terrazine collection initiated! It might take a little while, so just sit tight!
Conversation/acObj/Line02439=我发现一些敌方部队朝我的机器人扑过去了。他们这么想要那些地嗪啊。 /// I'm picking up some hostile forces headed for my bots. They must really want that terrazine.
Conversation/acObj/Line02440=敌人朝我的机器人摸过去了！这帮混蛋！ /// Enemies are headed for my bots! What a bunch of jerks!
Conversation/acObj/Line02441=敌人朝我的机器人靠过去了！难道他们不懂得尊重科学吗！？ /// Hostile forces are advancing on my bots! Have they no respect for science!?
Conversation/acObj/Line02442=我的机器人要死了……要死了…… /// (Sing-song voice) My bots are under attack... My bots are under attack...
Conversation/acObj/Line02443=什么东西原本是做得经久耐用，现在却惨遭破坏？当然是我的机器人了！ /// What's made to last forever and being destroyed? My bots, of course!
Conversation/acObj/Line02444=真是一个好机器人！欢迎回家！我想死你了！ /// That's a good little bot! Welcome home! I missed you so much!
Conversation/acObj/Line02445=机器人回来啦，机器人回来啦！ /// The bots are back in town, the bots are back in town! (Makes guitar noises)
Conversation/acObj/Line02446=我的机器人回来啦！没有我想的那么难嘛，手到“嗪”来啊！ /// My bots are back! That mean's it's "T" time. (Stage whispers) The "T" is for terrazine!
Conversation/acObj/Line02447=兄弟，采集地嗪很辛苦的。我们现在才采集了一半的量！ /// Man, collecting terrazine is hard work. We've only got about half of what I need!
Conversation/acObj/Line02448=再差那么一点就够了！胜利已经离我们近在咫尺！ /// Just a little more terrazine to go! Our victory is close at hand! (Devious laugh)
Conversation/acObj/Line02449=不敢相信他们一直在从那些动物身上提取地嗪。我为什么就没想到这点呢！？ /// I can't believe they were extracting terrazine from those things. Why didn't I think of that!?
Conversation/acObj/Line02450=采集程序已启动。很快，拜舍尔所有的地嗪都将是我的了！咩哈哈哈！ /// Collection protocol initiated. Soon, all of Bel'shir's terrazine will be mine! Muhahaha!
Conversation/acObj/Line02451=启动采集程序。拜托，请耐心点，这可是一道精密的工序！ /// Starting the collection process. Please be patient, this is a delicate procedure!
Conversation/acObj/Line02452=这些地嗪就快要变成人情了。哇哈哈！怎么，不会吗？这么刚直不阿？ /// This terrazine is about to become TERRANzine. Bwahaha! What, nothing? Oh come on.
Conversation/acObj/Line02453=这是收获的季节！我们来看看我们今年的地嗪庄稼收成如何。 /// Harvest time! Let's see what our terrazine crop looks like this year.
Conversation/acObj/Line02454=我的机器人正在吸取地嗪。必须尽快完工，不然拜舍尔就要生气了。 /// My bots are taking in the terrazine. It has to be done just right, or else Bel'shir will be angry.
Conversation/acObj/Line02455=我的天，他们竟然能把部队直接折跃在我的机器人旁边？我就知道星灵会用这招…… /// Oh man, they can warp in their forces right next to my bots? I guess I should have expected that from the protoss...
Conversation/acObj/Line02456=他们直接在机器人旁边折跃？！这也太过分了！ /// They're warping in right next to the bot!? That is totally overpowered!
Conversation/acObj/Line02457=敌人要空投了！没错……他们在我们的头上。快保护机器人！ /// Incoming enemy drop pods! Which means... (gulps, whispers) They're ABOVE us. Protect the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02458=敌人朝我的机器人丢空投部队了！天穹坠落！天穹坠落！ /// Enemy drop pods inbound on my bot! The sky is falling! The sky is falling!
Conversation/acObj/Line02459=他们正在我的机器人旁边空投部队！好在没有直接砸向我的机器人。 /// They're dropping in right next to my bot! At least they're not smashing into it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02460=天上下虫雨啦！死从天降啦！快救机器人！ /// It's raining zerg! Death from above! Save the bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02461=异虫正在我的机器人旁边直接空投！也不知道外面到底飘着多少利维坦？ /// The zerg are dropping down right next to my bot! How many Leviathans do they have up there?
Conversation/acObj/Line02462=异虫空投囊来袭！直接砸向了我的机器人！ /// Incoming zerg drop pods! They're headed right for my bot!
Conversation/acObj/Line02463=那是什么鬼？好像是个虚空撕裂者！原来真有这种东西啊！ /// What IS that thing? It looks like a Void Thrasher! I didn't know they actually exist!
Conversation/acObj/Line02464=虚空撕裂者？在这里？我还以为那些东西只存在于理论里！ /// A Void Thrasher? Here? I thought those were purely theoretical!
Conversation/acObj/Line02465=不……不可能……虚空撕裂者？！请告诉我这只是另一个幻像！ /// No... it can't be... a Void Thrasher!? Please tell me this is another hallucination!
Conversation/acObj/Line02466=那些虚空撕裂者是噩梦里才会有的东西。确切地说，是我的梦。 /// Those Void Thrashers are the stuff of nightmares. Mine, specifically.
Conversation/acObj/Line02467=噢，那是混合体吗？我还从没见过这种东西！真是神奇！ /// Oh wow, is that a hybrid? I haven't seen one in a while! Fascinating!
Conversation/acObj/Line02468=是混合体！难道帝国已经掌握了创造它们的基因剪接技术？ /// A hybrid! Does this mean the Dominion perfected the gene splicing tech to create them?
Conversation/acObj/Line02469=那东西……看上去是个混合体哎。在我的印象里，它们可是非常可怕的东西。 /// That... looks like a hybrid. From what I remember about them, that is very bad news.
Conversation/acObj/Line02470=有更多混合体来了。我真想看一眼培育它们的各种参数啊。 /// More hybrid on the way. I'd really like a glimpse at their breeding facility's configuration.
Conversation/acObj/Line02471=这些混合体和我之前见过的不一样。任务结束后，能不能让我研究一下它们？ /// These hybrid are different than the ones I've seen before. Any chance I could study them after this?
Conversation/acObj/Line02472=敌方混合体接近中！我在想地嗪会对它们的心智造成多大影响…… /// Hostile hybrid inbound! I wonder how terrazine affects their physiology...
Conversation/acObj/Line02473=他们已经摧毁了一个机器人？我可没时间再派另一个机器人赶往那处气泉！ /// They already destroyed one of the bots? I'll never get another one to that geyser in time!
Conversation/acObj/Line02474=敌人打掉了一个机器人！我来不及派另一个机器人赶过去，那处气泉就会自己关闭的。 /// The enemy's taken down a bot! The geyser's gonna seal itself before another one reaches it.
Conversation/acObj/Line02475=不是吧，那个机器人甚至都没有看清气泉长什么样！这下在气泉消失之前，我没办法再派另一台机器人过去了。 /// Aw man, that bot didn't even reach the geyser! There's no way I can send another one before it's gone.
Conversation/acObj/Line02476=呃，我的机器人挂了一个。如果挂得太多的话，我就没办法再采集地嗪了！ /// Well, there goes one of my bots. If we lose too many of them, I won't be able to harvest any more terrazine!
